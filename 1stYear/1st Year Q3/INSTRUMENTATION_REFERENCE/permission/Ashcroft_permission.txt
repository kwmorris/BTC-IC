Hello,

I teach Instrumentation and Control Technology at 
Bellingham Technical College in Washington State.  
My students use Ashcroft deadweight testers in their 
labwork, and I'd like to copy PDF manuals for my 
students to download and peruse in their labwork.  
Of particular interest is the manual for the model 
1305D tester, which we have three of in our lab.

Would it be permissible to download and copy your 
PDF manual(s) for this deadweight tester onto CD-ROM 
for distribution to the students?  These disks will 
not be sold, and will only be used for educational 
purposes.

Sincerely,
Tony Kuphaldt

Thank you for your request and yes you may copy and 
use the Ashcroft deadweight tester document in the 
manner you described.

Thank you for checking and if you need additional 
information, or images, don't hesitate to ask.

Yours truly,

Sue Matthews
