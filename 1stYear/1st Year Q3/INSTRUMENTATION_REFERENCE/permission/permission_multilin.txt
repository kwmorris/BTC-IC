Hello Delisle,

Mostly protective relays.  I would like to 
download and distribute datasheets, user manuals,
and other documentation for my students to 
research.

Question or Comments:
I am an instructor of Instrumentation and Control 
Technology, and would like permission to download, 
copy, and distribute PDF-format documentation to 
my students for their research and learning on 
line and motor protection products.  I typically 
provide datasheets, manuals, and other industry 
documents on CD-ROM for those students who have 
no or slow internet access, which is why I am 
asking for permission to copy and distribute 
these files.

The CD-ROM disks will be used for educational 
purposes only and will not be sold.

Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
