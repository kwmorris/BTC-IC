<p style="text-align: left;">Over the many years that I have been writing these articles in the Case
Histories Series, the one theme that reoccurs very frequently is
problems encountered with valves.&nbsp;In recent years I have been told
on quite a few occasions by people that their valve problems are over
as they have now made the huge and expensive step forward by replacing
all the positioners in their plants by smart positioners.&nbsp;I have
also been told that the smart positioners completely eliminate
hysteresis, and effectively cure all problems.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">A smart positioner is one which contains a microcomputer, and as
mentioned in other articles, another one of the fallacies I encounter
is the common belief that computers are perfect., can do no wrong, and
can sort out all problems.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Now, having been trained as an engineer around the time Noah came out of the
ark, and having been brought up on relatively primitive devices like
slide rules and log books, I am one of the biggest fans around when it
comes to computers, and really love them.&nbsp;However I do try and do
this in a sensible fashion, and realise that whilst computers do good
and at times wonderful things, they are only as good as the people who
program them, and in fact they can and do introduce complications that
may not have been present in the bad old "precomputer"
era.&nbsp;Therefore I was initially rather sceptical to hear these
wonderful and possibly wild claims about smart positioners.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">On talking to some very knowledgeable suppliers and manufacturers of
various makes of smart positioners I learnt that there are smart
positioners, and then there are really intelligent positioners, which
apparently go a few steps further than just "smart".&nbsp;However as
the engineering world is a very competitive place where the hard headed
accounting types who pay the bills, look very much at price as opposed
to specifications, you do have to pay more for the extra
intelligence.&nbsp;In other words you pay for what you get.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The main purpose of any positioner is to try and get the valve to the
position as dictated by the controller's accurately as
possible.&nbsp;Positioners were in fact introduced mainly to try and
eliminate hysteresis effects.&nbsp;The old type of pneumatic
positioners which have been around for many decades, did a pretty good
job, but like all pneumatic devices were relatively crude and
inaccurate.&nbsp;They only incorporated a P (proportional) only control
in positioning the valve.&nbsp;As mentioned in the Loop Signature
series P only control is likely to result in some offset, as it does
not try and eliminate the actual error.&nbsp;The I (integral) term is
needed to eliminate error completely.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Now most people I have spoken to seem to think that their smart positioners
definitely have a P + I controller in them.&nbsp;However several of the
smart positioner people I have spoken to, say that they only offer P +
I at an additional price.&nbsp;I personally think that there would not
all that much added benefit in purchasing a&nbsp; smart positioner
unless it did have a full P + I function.</span>
                </p>

<p style="text-align: left;">However one must be aware that the I term can also introduce problems, for if
it cannot eliminate the error for any reason, it will tend to keep
trying to move the valve in the direction needed to eliminate the
error.&nbsp;If the valve is sticking too much, then a bad overshoot, or
even continuous cycling (instability) can result.&nbsp;One must
obviously also ensure that a positioner with a P+I controller in it, is
correctly tuned for the particular valve/actuator combination.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">However good a smart positioner may be, it still cannot&nbsp;eliminate problems
caused by undersized (and hence underpowered) actuators.&nbsp;The
actuator provides the motive power to the valve.&nbsp;The positioner's
function is to tell the actuator how much to move the valve.&nbsp;It
cannot move the valve itself.&nbsp;Thus if the actuator has not got
enough power in it to overcome valve stiction easily and move the valve
properly, the positioner may push too much air into the actuator and
cause overshoot and possibly instability.&nbsp; As mentioned above this
will probably be made worse if the&nbsp;positioner has an I term in it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">To me one of the best and probably most important features available,
possibly at extra price on the "intelligent" positioners, is the valve
performance diagnostic ability that can be offered in these
devices.&nbsp;At least one of the better known makes actually can
communicate information on the state of the valve over the
internet.&nbsp;It continually monitors the performance of the valve's
actual position and response dynamics, and can sound warnings if the
valve's performance start deteriorating.&nbsp;Typically it can advise
of excessive stiction, hysteresis, overshoot, etc.&nbsp;As over 85% of
all loop problems are generally valve related, this is a huge benefit,
and if one is serious about optimisation, it is to me well worth the
expense of the device.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I am concerned that so many people think their valve problems are over
now they are using smart positioners.&nbsp;Over the past couple of
years I have come across quite a few examples of valves fitted with
smart positioners exhibiting horrific problems.&nbsp;To illustrate a
few, I have included some interesting tests below of flow loops with
valves using smart positioners which have been recorded during the last
few months.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Figure 1 shows an open loop test taken in a chemical plant.&nbsp;It shows the
response of the flow to step changes made on the PD (controller
output).&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    <table nof="TE" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
                        <tbody><tr>
                            <td align="center"><img id="Picture54" src="case_history_79_files/cashis79Fig_1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" title="Figure 1" border="0" height="448" width="600"></td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody></table>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 1</span></i></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As can be seen there is a big overshoot on each movement of the valve and
it takes a tremendously long time to recover.&nbsp;This is really a
weird response and one I have never seen before.&nbsp;Figure 2 shows
the closed loop test after tuning.&nbsp;The positioner/valve
combination is completely unstable when the controller is in automatic,
and with any reasonable tuning the positioner overshoots on every
reversal of the valve, which means it has to reveres the valve again.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">
                    <table nof="TE" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
                        <tbody><tr>
                            <td align="center"><img id="Picture55" src="case_history_79_files/cashis79Fig_2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" title="Figure 2" border="0" height="447" width="600"></td>

                <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 2</span></i></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Figure 3 is an open loop test on another flow loop performed in a mining application.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    <table nof="TE" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
                        <tbody><tr>
                            <td align="center"><img id="Picture56" src="case_history_79_files/cashis79Fig_3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" title="Figure 3" border="0" height="448" width="600"></td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody></table>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 3</span></i></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">This is one of the worst valves I have ever seen.&nbsp;Even valves without a
positioner or with old fashioned positioners don't perform so
badly.&nbsp;Everything is wrong.&nbsp;The positioner sometimes causes
huge overshoots, but not every time.&nbsp;The valve sticks badly at
times and the positioner does not seem capable of doing anything about
it.&nbsp;(Possibly it has a terribly undersized actuator).&nbsp;The
steps are all of different size, which I am pretty sure has nothing to
do with the valve characteristics.&nbsp;Most of the time the size of
the steps moving up seem very different to the size of the steps coming
down.&nbsp;All in all, the valve is completely non-repeatable, and
there is no possibility that any type of automatic control could be
achieved with it.&nbsp;It seems hard to believe that a valve like this
has got a smart positioner on it.&nbsp;Certainly not
intelligent.&nbsp;If anything I would say that the positioner suffers
from mental defects!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Figure 4 is shows a similar test performed on another flow loop in the same mine.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    <table nof="TE" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
                        <tbody><tr>
                            <td align="center"><img id="Picture57" src="case_history_79_files/cashis79Fig_4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" title="Figure 4" border="0" height="446" width="600"></td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody></table>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 4</span></i></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">It shows very similar, mostly non-repeatable problems The valves and
positioners were supplied by one of the world's largest manufacturers
of high quality process control equipment. The plant incidentally is
very new and has been operating for just over a year.&nbsp;I was told
when I started my work there that it was unlikely that I would find any
valve problems because firstly everything was so new, and secondly they
had gone for the top of the range smart positioners.&nbsp;However
nobody seemed to have picked up these problems prior to my visit.&nbsp;
The problems they were having with control was put down to poor
tuning.&nbsp;Yet most of their valves were suffering from the sort of
problems seen in these examples.&nbsp;Surely so called smart
positioners should have been able to inform the user of the problems? </span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I have no desire to leave the reader with the impression that smart
positioners are necessarily not good.&nbsp; There is no doubt that they
can offer tremendous benefits.&nbsp;However what I have tried to do
here is to sound a warning that one may encounter problems just as bad
if not worse with them as one did with the old fashioned types of
positioners, and before investing blindly in expensive equipment like
this, some research should be done to ensure the make you get is really
offering you advantages, and to especially make sure it has the correct
analytical abilities to sound warning of problems.</span></p>
