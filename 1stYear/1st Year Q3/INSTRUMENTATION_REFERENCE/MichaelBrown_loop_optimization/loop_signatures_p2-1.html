                <p><b><span style="font-size: small;">Introduction to Part 2 loop signatures and process transfer functions</span></b></p>
                <p><b>Introduction to Part 2</b></p>
                <p>The
previous series of loop signature articles dealt with the basics of
control loop optimisation, and concentrated on trouble shooting, and
looked at "SWAG" tuning of simple processes.&nbsp;Apart from cascade
control it only dealt with single input, single output loops in
isolation from other possible interactive systems.</p>
                <p>The series is now available on CDRom that can be ordered via our web site <a href="http://www.controlloop.co.za/">www.controlloop.co.za</a>. </p>
                <p>In
this new series, consideration will be given to dealing practically
with more difficult things like interactive processes, and with
processes with much more complex dynamics.</p>
                <p>In
addition there will be more "tying up" of the practice to the
theory.&nbsp;As a result you will get a much better understanding of
the practice, and it will give you much more self-confidence in finding
solutions to what can sometimes be difficult problems.&nbsp;Many
delegates who have passed through our courses have reported back that
the second Part has proved equally, if not even more valuable, than the
first part, and in many instances they have managed to very
successfully automate loops that previously had only run in manual.</p>
                <p><b>Process Transfer Functions</b></p>
                <p>As
shown in Figure 1 a process transfer function is merely a mathematical
function describing how the output of a process will respond to any
change on the input to that process.&nbsp;It is literally and simply a
mathematical description of the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <table nof="TE" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
                        <tbody><tr>
                            <td align="center"><img id="Picture8" src="loop_signatures_p2-1_files/loopsigsp2-Fig1.gif" alt="Figure 1" title="Figure 1" border="0" height="346" width="500"></td>

                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Figure 1</i></p>
                <p>Now
as mentioned in the Part 1 this function was considered by the
mathematical control theory pioneers to be an absolute essential
element which was needed in order to tune the controller.&nbsp; However
unfortunately process transfer functions are relatively complex as both
time and frequency responses are involved, and the best way of writing
the functions is to use Laplace arithmetic.</p>
                <p>Apart
from the complexity of this for ordinary C&amp;I people who mostly last
touched on Laplace in distant studies at their educational
institutions, it was historically found that it was extremely
difficult, if not almost impossible, to actually practically establish
the various dynamic Laplace constants of industrial processes by either
frequency testing or from modelling them by making step changes on the
process input.&nbsp;As a result most people forgot about all the theory
they had learnt, and proceeded to "fly be the seats of their pants",
and as a result 98% of all optimisation was (and in fact generally
still is) performed by WAG (Wild Ass Guess) or SWAG (Scientific Wild
Ass Guess) methods.</p>
                <p>Now
in fact as far as the author is concerned, in certain respects the need
for process transfer functions is still as important today as it ever
was.&nbsp;As will be seen the whole of this second series of Loop
Signatures will be dealing with these functions.&nbsp;In many instances
as will be seen, and provided the C&amp;I practitioner has the right
tools for the job, it will not be generally necessary for him or her to
be too worried about very accurate values of the dynamic constants, and
simplified transfer functions can in fact do a great job for certain
tasks as will be seen a little later in the series.</p>
                <p>However
as also will be shown it is ABSOLUTELY VITAL when it comes to tuning
that the practitioner is aware of what constants are in fact present in
the process response, and in some cases the relationship between the
magnitudes of some of these constants is very important.&nbsp;Once you
have established these things, one can then&nbsp;decide how best to
apply different types of tuning to different types of dynamics, with
sometimes startling improvements in control performance.</p>
                <p>How
can one establish the process transfer function dynamic constants in
the modern world, when full frequency testing is not possible?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple
first order lag, deadtime models can be determined graphically as
described in the first series.&nbsp;(Now before I get a flood of
correspondence from people who would rightfully say that in the first
series, I mentioned that these models are seldom good enough for good
feedback tuning, please bear with me until later in the series where
hopefully I will prove that although it is true for feedback tuning,
some more advanced things like feedback compensators and decouplers are
far less critical when it comes to tuning, and simple models generally
are usually sufficient to tune them.)</li>
                    <li>If
you are fortunate enough to have access to a Protuner loop analysis
software package, it gives simple first order lag, deadtime model on
the tuning report, OR a much more complex model can be established from
the relatively simple modeling procedures in the frequency plot section.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To summarise why it is necessary to have information of process transfer functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As stressed above, a rough idea of the elements in the function should always be established when optimising any process</li>
                    <li>Simple
first order lag, deadtime models are needed for "SWAG" tuning methods,
and are usually sufficient for tuning decouplers in feedforward and
interactive control</li>
                    <li>More complex models are often needed for off-line process simulation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In
the next article in this second loop signature series we will be taking
a look at an extremely powerful control tool, viz. feedforward, which
in my opinion is not used nearly enough.</p>
