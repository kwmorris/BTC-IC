                <p><b><span style="font-size: small;">Problems beyond belief!</span></b></p>
                <p>As
mentioned several times previously in this series of articles, the
biggest and most frustrating problem I encounter in the field of
optimisation of regulatory control loops, is the almost blind refusal
of people to recognise that the vast majority of control loops in their
plant are almost certainly not working efficiently and that a huge
number of problems in the loops are sure to exist of which they are
generally completely unaware.&nbsp;This applies particularly not only
to senior management, but also to many senior control engineers who
seem to be under the impression that most of the so called "base layer"
loops are working reasonable well, and that optimisation is merely
tuning, and that most problems can be fixed by tuning.&nbsp;Furthermore
they also often seem to believe that optimisation is a simple exercise
that does not require highly skilled people.</p>
                <p>I
have now carried out optimisation exercises in well over 500 plants in
quite a few countries around the world, and have never yet been in a
plant where on my initial inspection, more than 5% of the loops are
operating reasonably well.&nbsp;Many of these plants are considered to
be industrial leaders in their fields of manufacture, and it is not as
if they don't have the resources or access to skilled personnel if they
want to use them.&nbsp;They have control systems costing millions of
Rands, Dollars, Pounds or Euros, which are largely there for automatic
loop control, but don't really seem at all interested in getting them
to work properly.&nbsp;Apart from that, the loss of potential profits
is surely mid-boggling.</p>
                <p>In
many plants today the emphasis is on implementation of advanced control
strategies.&nbsp;The vast majority of advanced control systems'
operation depend on the advanced control system setting the setpoints
of simple PID controllers in the base layer.&nbsp;So how can advanced
control work properly if the base layer is not doing a proper
job?&nbsp;Often I am told that the advanced control vendors do usually
come in and optimise the base layer before commissioning the advanced
system.</p>
                <p>The
people who are sent in by the advanced control vendors are mostly
young, often highly qualified engineers.&nbsp;Unfortunately they
generally have very little real plant experience, and have very little
knowledge, understanding or training in the practicalities of
optimisation, and they go quickly around the plant readjusting PID
parameter settings, and in actuality achieving very little.</p>
                <p>I
have been into quite a few plants where these so called experts have
performed such "optimisation", and have found that generally the base
controls are not working any better after the exercise than they did
before.&nbsp;Also typically you find that very little time has been
allocated to the base layer optimisation exercise.&nbsp;In one plant
with over 600 control loops which I was recently in, only 10 working
days had been allowed for base layer optimisation.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In
general on really fast loops like flow and small capacity levels, one
does extremely well if you can optimise between 10 and 15 loops in a
day.&nbsp;When it comes to slow processes like many temperature loops,
you may be lucky to optimise two loops in a&nbsp;day.&nbsp;A large
processing plant with many thousand of loops embarked on a proper major
optimisation exercise a little over a year ago.&nbsp;They have
established a special department to perform optimising and implement
advanced control.&nbsp;(They firstly identified loops with major
problems on them by employing a continuous loop performance monitoring
package).&nbsp;To date they say they have optimised 250 loops in just
under 6 months, and have achieved unbelievable financial benefits just
from optimising those relatively few loops.&nbsp;They tell me it will
take them years to really get the whole plant control system properly
optimised.</p>
                <p>To give an
example of the normal approach to optimisation by many control
managers, a large chemical plant in Europe asked me to tender for a
loop tuning packet.&nbsp;They had attached a specification.&nbsp;The
person who had written it had obviously little experience of
optimisation, and had collected information from as many manufacturers
of loop tuning packets that he could find.&nbsp;He had then taken what
he felt were the best points, and had then drafted the
specification.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Typically
it called for at least five different tuning calculation methods after
a test.&nbsp;The author didn't appear to appreciate that if a tuning is
done properly for a particular desired speed of response, then only one
set of parameters can be correct if you want pole cancellation tuning
which is universally accepted as the most effective tuning.&nbsp;The
reason why many tuning packages offer several types of tunings is that
they employ "SWAG" tuning methods, none of which work very well, and
most certainly cannot cope with more complex dynamics.&nbsp;Therefore
the manufacturer of the tuning package gives you several methods to
try, hoping one may work better than the others on a particular
loop.&nbsp;(Refer to chapter 23 of my CD "Basic Trouble Shooting and
Loop Tuning" for a description of SWAG tuning methods).</p>
                <p>Then
in the specification for the loop tuning package, there was a
requirement that the package should give different speed of tuning
responses with a comparison against expected increase in valve life
with less aggressive tunings (a feature that one manufacturer
offers).&nbsp;This is all well in theory and in fact in practice, as
there is a more or less a directly proportional relationship of valve
wear to speed of response of tuning.&nbsp;However in reality this is
just one of the many factors one should take into consideration for all
tunings, and it would be far more realistic to take it into account in
conjunction with the amount and frequency of changes in control error
that will occur on that particular loop.&nbsp;For example on very noisy
level loops where one would expect to have much higher proportional
controller gains, and if one would like to avoid filtering, then you
may well wish to use a slower tune to avoid shortening the valve
life.&nbsp;However the tuning response speed must be chosen with many
other factors in mind besides the effect on valve life.&nbsp;(Again
refer to chapter 28 of the above referenced CD).</p>
                <p>Apart
from that the specification only asked for tuning.&nbsp;It had nothing
covering loop analysis, which in fact is probably even more important
than the tuning, for as I have said many, many times, tuning is
generally a complete waste of time without first carrying out proper
loop analysis.&nbsp;Tuning blindly as an exercise by itself may be
successful in roughly only 50% of all cases &#8211; if you are really very
lucky.</p>
                <p>To
cut a long story short, I then contacted the chief control engineer at
the plant, and told him of my experiences and concerns, and suggested
he read some of the Case Histories articles on my web site, to get some
better understanding of what I was trying to tell him.&nbsp;I then
offered, as is my practice in similar cases, to spend a couple of days
on his plant free of charge, and provided he paid my travelling and
living expenses, to carry out a very preliminary loop audit of a few of
the faster loops in the plant to get some idea of how well his base
layer was performing.</p>
                <p>Very
often in such a situation people ask me to work on real problem loops
which they are aware of and cannot fix.&nbsp;However difficult loops
like this may take days to sort out and may in fact not be controllable
at all.&nbsp;What I would rather do on such an exercise, is to optimise
as many fast simple loops in the short time available, and then see how
many were in fact working well.&nbsp;I usually find that very few, if
any, are working well.&nbsp;My question to the client is then if simple
loops like this, which he previously thought were fine, are in fact not
working properly, then what chance is there that more difficult loops
could be operating well?</p>
                <p>This
client took me up on my offer, and I visited the site to perform the
audit.&nbsp;I looked at about 20 relatively fast and simple loops in
the 2 days.&nbsp;As previously expected none were operating
well.&nbsp;However what was more shocking was the fact that most were
not even capable of being optimised.&nbsp;This was due to various
reasons ranging from loop design errors, poor control strategies, and
even more worrying was the fact that most of the valves were in a
terrible state of repair.</p>
                <p>Given below are the findings on three of the loops taken at random from the audit.</p>
                <p>The
first example was a flow loop which everyone thought was a good example
of a simple loop that really operated well.&nbsp;I always ask for
drawings like P&amp;ID's showing how the loop fits into the
system.&nbsp;In this case I was told that I didn't need any drawings,
as it really was so simple.&nbsp;It consisted of a liquid being pumped
out of a tank with a&nbsp;flow meter and control valve downstream and
then the flow was discharged straight into another vessel.&nbsp;What
could be simpler than this?</p>
                <p>Immediately
on commencing with the first closed loop "as found" test (i.e. using
the existing tuning), it was found things didn't work
properly.&nbsp;Very little occurred on setpoint changes.&nbsp;We then
went out into the field to inspect the valve and found that it had a
manual bypass valve around it, which was wide open.&nbsp;This was
closed and the test restarted.</p>
                <p>The
control seemed to work reasonably well for a while although very
detuned so it responded extremely slowly to any changes.&nbsp;The
suddenly the flow started drifting away from setpoint and then the loop
went into a completely unstable cycle.&nbsp;This is shown in Figure
1.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><img id="Picture9" src="case_history_87_files/cashis87Fig_1.jpg" alt="cashis87Fig 1" title="cashis87Fig 1" align="top" border="0" height="447" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 1</i></p>
                <p>Another
trip into the field and when walking along the pipe it was found a
second control valve was in series with the first and it formed part of
a second control loop for something else, the reason for which nobody
could explain.&nbsp;The operators had obviously opened the bypass on
the first valve to prevent it interfering with the second control.</p>
                <p>This
is an excellent example of a loop that everyone was sure was really
operating well.&nbsp;Try and put advanced control on that one!</p>
                <p>The
next example was another supposedly "working well" flow loop.&nbsp;Once
again the first thing discovered was that its bypass valve was wide
open.&nbsp;(Operators were really getting cunning in the
plant.&nbsp;The best way to get rid of pesky control problems is to
control using the bypass.&nbsp;Even better than switching to
manual).&nbsp;There was very poor and intermittent response in
automatic.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Figure 2 shows the open loop test.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><img id="Picture10" src="case_history_87_files/cashis87Fig_2.jpg" alt="cashis87Fig 2" title="cashis87Fig 2" align="top" border="0" height="446" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 2</i></p>
                <p>It
can be seen how sticky the valve was.&nbsp;However, much worse, there
was a huge overshoot&nbsp;every time the valve was reversed.&nbsp;Huge
overshoots on valve reversals put a complete block on any form of
reasonable control in automatic, as it will lead to cycling.&nbsp;There
is no way this loop could be made to perform until the valve is
repaired or replaced.</p>
                <p>The
third example again illustrates a very bad valve which had a massive
21% hysteresis.&nbsp;(Normal hysteresis should be less than 1% for good
control).&nbsp;The valve was also twice oversized..&nbsp;Figure 3 is
the open loop test showing how much the controller output had to move
before the valve could get through the hysteresis.&nbsp; </p>
                <p><img id="Picture11" src="case_history_87_files/cashis87Fig_3.jpg" alt="cashis87Fig 3" title="cashis87Fig 3" align="top" border="0" height="408" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 3</i></p>
                <p>Figure
4 is a closed loop test (with good tuning) showing the same thing, but
it also shows very nicely how it takes a long time to reverse a valve
with bad hysteresis.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><img id="Picture12" src="case_history_87_files/cashis87Fig_4.jpg" alt="cashis87Fig 4" title="cashis87Fig 4" align="top" border="0" height="406" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 4</i></p>
                <p>This
is performed by the integral action.&nbsp;With the normal poor tuning I
find in many plants it would have taken close on half an hour to
reverse the valve.</p>
                <p>There were many more examples
of problems like these, and also of poor loop design and process
problems which were uncovered in the audit.&nbsp;Incidentally as
mentioned earlier, not one single loop was found to be operating at all
well in automatic, yet the people in the plant believed that all they
had to do to get the loops working well was to get a good tuning
packet.&nbsp;They had no idea of the problems that existed and in fact
originally would not really believe me when I said that such problems
were sure to exist in abundance.</p>
                <p>Once
again it is proved that if you wish to get your base loop layer working
properly, thorough analysis is required before tuning can be carried
out.</p>
