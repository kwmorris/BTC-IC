            <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica>The case of the 
            mysterious cycle on a paper machine </FONT></B>
            <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>I personally 
            find the control of paper machines extremely interesting.&nbsp; As 
            in many other plants, we generally find the vast majority of the 
            regulatory controls on the paper machines are working extremely 
            badly; and I am talking of literally many dozens of machines that 
            several colleagues and I have worked on between us.&nbsp; As I have 
            stated in quite a few previous articles, it is really due to the 
            innate skills of the operators that good quality paper is 
            produced.&nbsp; However if more paper companies were only prepared 
            to invest some capital, manpower, and time in properly optimising 
            their controls, the savings in costs, wastage, and in making less 
            broke would be immense, let alone the potential improvement in 
            quality.
            <P>The controls in a paper machine are very important as all the 
            processes from the wet to the dry end follow on from each 
            other.&nbsp; Therefore if you can minimize control variance right 
            from the beginning of the processes at the wet end, things will 
            improve as the sheet moves down the machine.&nbsp; It is really 
            important that virtually all the controls be set up properly.&nbsp; 
            Even one control performing badly can have a ripple effect all the 
            way down the line.
            <P>I came across a wonderful example of this very recently, when 
            working on optimising a paper machine in a South African paper 
            plant.&nbsp; This was a strange problem that was occurring on the 
            output of the Blending Chest.&nbsp; Figure 1 illustrates the typical 
            control loops that may be encountered on a Blending Chest.&nbsp; 
            Essentially a Blending Chest is used to mix together the right 
            quantities of the various pulp constituents that would be used in 
            the manufacture of a particular type of paper.</FONT></P></TD>

            <P>The master control on the chest is the level.&nbsp; Strangely 
            enough this is the least important of the various loops from the 
            control point of view.&nbsp; The actual level in the chest is in 
            fact not critical at all.&nbsp; The only reason that a level control 
            is there at all is to keep the level within reasonable limits, and 
            to prevent it from going too high or too low.
            <P>The level is controlled by varying the cascaded inflows of the 
            different pulp constituents in various ratios.&nbsp; Each of the 
            individual constituent flows also usually has other controls 
            upstream.&nbsp; For example, consistency, which can be roughly 
            defined as the amount of wood fibres in the pulp stock, is 
            controlled on each constituent by adding dilution water to that 
            stock.&nbsp; (These controls are not shown in Figure 1).&nbsp; Also 
            some or all of the various stocks may pass through refiners which 
            are machines containing 2 large plates rotating in close proximity 
            to each other, which effectively crush down coarser fibres.
            <P>Now the consistency controls, and the refiners in particular, do 
            not operate well if the flow of pulp through them varies 
            rapidly.&nbsp; The flows are set by the output of the master level 
            control.&nbsp; As mentioned in previous articles, if you wish to 
            have "tight" level control it usually is necessary to have 
            relatively high proportional gains in the level controller, which 
            results in fairly large and possibly rapid movements in the output 
            of the level controller.&nbsp; For this reason and as the Blend 
            Chest level is not important, it is really imperative that the level 
            be detuned to respond slowly, to avoid introducing rapid 
            fluctuations in the stock constituents flows.
            <P>Whilst optimising the level of the Blend Chest it was noted that 
            the level appeared to be cycling slightly and fairly slowly with a 
            cycle period of approximately 2 minutes.&nbsp; The level controller 
            was put into manual to stop the cycle but if still continued.&nbsp; 
            As there was nothing else causing major inflows into the chest, it 
            was concluded that the cycle must be caused by something further 
            downstream from the chest, causing the flow coming out of the chest 
            to cycle.
            <P>Figure 2 shows the configuration of the plant downstream from the 
            Blend Chest.</FONT></P></TD>

            <P>The stock is pumped out of the chest, and then passes through a 
            final consistency control, after which it passes though a tickler 
            (like a small refiner), and then on through a control valve before 
            passing into the Machine Chest.&nbsp; This control valve is for 
            controlling level in the Machine Chest, and is operated via a flow 
            controller cascaded from the output of the Machine Chest level 
            controller.&nbsp; In addition to all this, there is a small pipe 
            after the tickler recirculating stock to the Blend Chest via a flow 
            control valve.&nbsp; The purpose of this control is to ensure that a 
            constant flow of stock passes through the tickler at all 
            times.&nbsp; Thus for example if the Machine Chest level controller 
            got too high and the level control valve started closing, then the 
            recirculation valve would in turn open further to keep a constant 
            flow through the tickler.
            <P>The cycle seen on the Blend Chest level could of course have been 
            caused by a cycle in any of these three control loops (viz. 
            consistency, recirculation flow, or level control cascade flow 
            loop).&nbsp; The next step was to put all these 3 loops in manual as 
            well as the inflow loops to the Blend Chest.&nbsp; To our amazement 
            the cycle continued after all the loops were in manual.&nbsp; It is 
            illustrated in Figure 3.&nbsp; The actual recording in the figure 
            was taken from a pressure transmitter (not shown in drawings) that 
            was on the output of the pump on the Blend 
        Chest.</FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD>

      <P>With all control loops in manual and no changes being made to any of 
      the various controller's outputs it was very hard to understand what could 
      cause the cycle.&nbsp; The effects of the cycle were of course extremely 
      serious, as everything both downstream and upstream would respond to the 
      cycle, when the controllers were in automatic, and good control at this 
      stage of the paper making process is really critical.&nbsp; One most 
      certainly does not want consistencies, blends, and refiner flows to move 
      up and down in a 9% amplitude cycle every 2 minutes.&nbsp; The recording 
      shown in Figure 4 is an excellent illustration showing how various other 
      controls, including the Blend Chest level and the constituent stock 
      inflows were following the cycle.</FONT></P></TD>

      <P>It was initially concluded that the problem must lie with the pump on 
      the output of the Blend Chest, even though it was difficult to visualise 
      what could cause a pump to exhibit such a strange phenomenon.&nbsp; As 
      nothing could be done about this whilst the plant was running, it was decided 
      to carry on optimising and tuning the loops leading up to the machine 
      chest, until such time as the plant was stopped and the pump could be 
      opened up and inspected.&nbsp; 
      <P>Whilst performing the tests to optimise the Machine Chest level control 
      system, it was noted that some very strange things happened whenever the 
      valve was moved, with the flow seeming to vary all over the place.&nbsp; 
      On physically examining the valve it was found that there were problems 
      with it, and the valve was moving around slowly even when in the 
      controller was in manual.&nbsp; This then was the cause of the 
      cycle.&nbsp; This is something really unexpected and extremely hard to 
      uncover.&nbsp; It is actually very difficult to see a valve stem moving 
      slowly over a&nbsp; small range. One actually needs to attach a stem 
      position transmitter to be able to examine it properly. 
      <P>It is also extremely rare to find a valve that is unstable and moving 
      around with a constant input signal.&nbsp; In the few previous cases where 
      I have encountered such valves, the movements were either random 
      (sometimes caused by too low an air supply pressure to the 
      valve/positioner combination), or else cyclic with a relatively short 
      period (usually some instability in the positioner).&nbsp; I have never 
      seen something of this nature before, but it certainly created havoc in a 
      critical area in the process.
      <P>It was coincidental that when optimising one of the blend flow input 
      loops, we encountered another unstable positioner.&nbsp; In this case the 
      valve was cycling with relatively much shorter period.&nbsp; The open loop 
      test where this was discovered is illustrated in Figure 5.&nbsp;

      <P>It shows that as the valve opens in response to step changes on the PD 
      (controller output) signal the flow increases but once it got over 30%, a 
      cycle appeared on the flow signal, the amplitude of which increased the 
      further the valve opened.&nbsp; Another thing to note from the test is 
      that the valve has non-linear installed characteristics, which can be seen 
      from the fact that on each movement of the PD (which was changed with 
      equal steps), the increases in the size of the steps of flow decreased a 
      little on each subsequent step.
      <P>Another relatively serious control problem was also encountered on 
      another of the flow loops of the pulp stock constituents, which is shown 
      in Figure 6.&nbsp; </FONT></P></TD>

      <P>In this case it was found that the maximum flow that could be attained 
      by the flow loop was only 20% of the maximum scale and when the PD was 
      below 30%.&nbsp; Once the PD moved above this point no further increase in 
      flow was possible.&nbsp; An examination of the physical layout of the 
      process showed that the flow line joined into another flow line at a point 
      where the pressure in the second line was too high to allow much inflow 
      from the joining line.&nbsp; It was suggested that the pipe carrying the 
      pulp be extended directly to the Blend Chest. 
      <P>Apart from these problems it is interesting to note that not one of the 
      loops we worked on was working efficiently in automatic.&nbsp; Some of the 
      magnetic flowmeters had filters on of a minute or more (which is 
      unbelievable).&nbsp; Most of the&nbsp; flow loops were so badly detuned 
      that after optimisation, response times were improved by an average of 
      about 200 times, and in one noteworthy case, over 2,000 times!
      <P>The really interesting thing about all this is that until we started 
      this work, the production people had no idea of the existence of these 
      serious problems, and of the state of their controls, and as mentioned in 
      the first paragraph of this article this is pretty common on most paper 
      machines we work on, and in many other types of plants as well.&nbsp; 
      <P>I firmly believe that it would pay large processing plants hundreds of 
      times over, to seriously consider introducing an optimisation programme, 
      which should be treated as a separate and important discipline.</FONT>
