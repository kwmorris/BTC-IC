Tony,

That's fine - so long as you don't alter the document in any way.

To Whom it may Concern,

I am an instructor of instrumentation at Bellingham
Technical College in Washington state, and I would 
like to include the PDF document on your site 
showing hydraulic diagram symbols on a reference CD-ROM for my students' use:  

http://www.hydraulicsupermarket.com/upload/db_documents_doc_19.pdf

The CD-ROM I will be burning for my students will 
be given to them without cost, and it will be 
used for their education only.  All I need is your 
permission to copy and distribute the PDF document 
which is on your website.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
