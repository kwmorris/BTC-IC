Sorry about the delay in responding to your message.

Certainly I have no objection to your proposed use of these lecture 
notes.  In fa ct I would a little proud if the students found them of 
some use.

As you may note, they are now available only as individual files for 
each lecture.  However, I am compiling them into a single volume (to 
save total file size), with some minor editing and with a short 
foreword.  I hope to have that ready in a few weeks and the result 
will be posted on the web.  In fact one reason for the delay in this 
reply was that I was hoping to have this ready.  However I have been 
too busy  with research affairs to get around to it.
