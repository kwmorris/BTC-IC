Dear Tony
I am very happy to give you permission to place this material on student 
CD-Rom's as you have proposed.
I thank you for showing interest in our book and web site.
We know that not all of the material is easy but we firmly believe, based 
on our design experience,  that this material is important when faced with 
real world control system design problems.
We trust that your students benefit from the availability of the material.
Kind regards and best wishes.
Graham ( Goodwin)
