Subject RE: Website Inquiry - Bellingham Technical College for Annunciator

Hi Greg,
 
I'm currently compiliing a reference CD-ROM for 
students, filled with user's guides and 
maintenance manuals for all kinds of different 
instruments as I get permission from various 
manufacturers to copy and distribute their files.  
Would it be permissible to copy the instruction 
manual PDF file onto these CD-ROMs for my students?
These disks would not be sold, but given to 
students for educational use only.  Thank you.
 
- Tony

No problem at all.  Are you looking for any other 
equipment other than that of the Series 90 that 
you will be using?  We have many of the instruction 
manuals on our website as well as additional ones 
available on request.  Let me know.

Regards,
