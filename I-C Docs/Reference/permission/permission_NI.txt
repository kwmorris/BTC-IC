Hi Tony: 

These are public documents and yes you can copy 
them onto disks.  Hope this helps.  Look forward 
to your cRio adoption in the future in the labs.

Thanks,

Hi Avi,

I would like to get permission from NI to copy PDF 
datasheets on data acquisition devices to a CD-ROM
so that students have offline access to them.  
These CD-ROM disks will not be sold, and they will 
be used strictly for educational purposes.  Many 
of my students have no or slow internet connections 
at home, and so having all the datasheets they need
for research and homework in an offline format is 
quite helpful.
    
If you could connect me to the right person at NI 
to give permission to copy these documents, I 
would appreciate.  These are all documents found
on the NI website (e.g. USB-6008 manual).
