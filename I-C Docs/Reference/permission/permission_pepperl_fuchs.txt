To Whom it may Concern,

I am an instructor of instrumentation at Bellingham 
Technical College in Washington state, and am in 
the process of compiling a reference CD-ROM for 
my students' use.  Having an "offline" reference is 
important for students who do not have fast internet 
service, or internet service at all at their homes.  
I am interested in copying PDF files available for 
download from your website on to these disks.  
I am particularly interested in documents related 
to intrinsic safety (especially the "Process 
Automation Engineer's Guide").

Please let me know if this use of your material 
would be permissible.  These CD-ROM disks will 
only be used for students' educational purposes, 
and they will not be sold.  Of course I will 
give proper attribution to you as the author and 
provider of this material on the CD-ROM.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
