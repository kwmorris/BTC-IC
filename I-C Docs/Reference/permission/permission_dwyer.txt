Subject: Permission to copy and distribute PDF files from website

To Whom it may Concern,

I am an instructor of instrumentation at Bellingham 
Technical College in Washington state, and am in the 
process of compiling a reference CD-ROM for my 
students' use.  Having an "offline" reference is 
important for students who do not have fast internet 
service, or internet service at all at their homes.  
I am interested in copying some of your technical 
reference PDF files from your website and copying 
them on to these disks, specifically (but not limited
to) the catalog pages and services manuals for your 
Magnehelic and Photohelic pressure gauge models.

Please let me know if this use of your material would
be permissible.  These CD-ROM disks will only be used
for students' educational purposes, and they will not
be sold.  Of course I will give proper attribution to
you as the author and provider of this material on 
the CD-ROM.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
