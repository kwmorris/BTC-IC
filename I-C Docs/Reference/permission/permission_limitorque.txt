To Whom it may Concern,

I am an instructor of instrumentation at 
Bellingham Technical College in Washington state, 
and am in the process of compiling a reference 
CD-ROM for my students' use.  Having an "offline" 
reference is important for students who do not 
have fast internet service, or internet service 
at all at their homes.  I am interested in 
copying PDF files available for download from 
your website on to these disks.  

Please let me know if this use of your material 
would be permissible.  These CD-ROM disks will 
only be used for students' educational purposes, 
and they will not be sold.  Of course I will 
give proper attribution to you as the author and 
provider of this material on the CD-ROM.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
