To Whom it may concern,

I teach Instrumentation at Bellingham Technical College and am
currently preparing instructional material for the 2002-2003 school
year.

The purpose of this email is to request permission to copy some of the
technical reference and datasheet literature files downloaded from your
company's website onto CD-ROMs for my students to use in their research.
 Not all my students have access to the internet, so having these files
available in an "off-line" format would greatly enhance their ability to
research current instrument technologies.

If this would not be acceptable, please let me know, and I will simply
direct my students' attention to your website where they can browse the
materials on-line.  Conversely, if this is acceptable, please send me
written permission for copying and distributing these files, and I will
include it as a notice in the CD-ROMs, along with the downloaded
literature.

As I am currently on my summer break from teaching (until mid-September
2002), please reply to this personal email address
(tonykuphaldt@mailcity.com), and/or by my home phone:
(360)-734-9936.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.


Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
