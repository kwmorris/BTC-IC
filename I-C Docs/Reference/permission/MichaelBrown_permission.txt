Hi Tony,

You may certainly reproduce them on CD Rom.  I only ask that you 
please mention that I am the author.

I am extremely keen on pushing the "art" of practical control.  Its 
almost a crusade of mine, as the vast majority of regulatory control 
systems are operating completely inefficiently, and virtually nobody is 
a ware of this or evens believes it.

I would appreciate it if you could send me a copy of the CD Rom.  I 
am sure I can learn some things from it.

Kind regards,

Mike Brown****************************************
