Tony,

Yes, you have our permission to download and use 
these files as you see fit.

We are in the process of creating a Process Control
Binder on Disk............ It's not ready yet, but, 
I could probably obtain a copy and allow you to 
copy the disk.

If the PCB disk better suits your needs......
Let me know.

Thanks,

Tim

Comments 

To Whom it may Concern, 

I am an instructor of instrumentation at Bellingham 
Technical College in Washington state, and am in 
the process of compiling a reference CD-ROM for my 
students' use.  Having an "offline" reference is 
important for students who do not have fast internet 
service, or internet service at all at their homes. 
I am interested in copying the following PDF file 
from your website and copying it on to these disks: 

    * CPI/A-Lok tiube fittings (catalog 4230/4233) 

Please let me know if this use of your material 
would be permissible.  These CD-ROM disks will only 
be used for students' educational purposes, and 
they will not be sold.  Of course I will give 
proper attribution to you as the author and provider
of this material on the CD-ROM.  Thank you for your 
time and consideration.

Sincerely, 

Tony Kuphaldt
