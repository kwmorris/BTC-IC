Dear Mr. Kuphaldt,

Thank you for taking the time to write this email
and to ask for permission.  That should not be a 
problem at all.  I can offer to send you some of 
our CD-ROM disks which has all of our most up-to-
date literature included.  If so, just let me know 
how many and where to send them to.  If you only 
have some specific documents you would like to 
provide to your students, then by all means copy 
them to a disk and hand them out in class as needed.

Best Regards,

Megan M. Foster
