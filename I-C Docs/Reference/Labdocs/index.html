<h2>BTC Fisheries hatchery facilities</h2>

<p>Bellingham Technical College's Fisheries Technology program operates two hatcheries: one for salmon and one for trout.  The salmon hatchery is called the <i>Perry Center</i>, and is located on ``C'' street near Holly street in old-town Bellingham.  The trout hatchery is located at Whatcom Falls Park along Lakeway Drive.</p>

<h2>Cedar Grove Park</h2>

<p>A retirement community named <i>Cedar Grove Park</i> located on Samish Way (near Lake Padden) in Bellingham has invited BTC Instrumentation students to construct projects for their use.  Our first project there was a water flow monitor for their potable water distribution piping system, which used to suffer regular and costly leaks.  Our second project there was a water quality monitoring system for the small lake in the center of their community.</p>

<li><a href="CGP_watersystem_RTU_1.jpg"><b>Photograph of the RTU sensing incoming water flow from the City of Bellingham</b></a>, this RTU consists of a Koyo ``CLICK'' PLC sensing a contact signal from a water flowmeter (1 pulse per gallon) and relaying that data through a 900 MHz radio link to an HMI unit installed at the maintenance shop.</li>
