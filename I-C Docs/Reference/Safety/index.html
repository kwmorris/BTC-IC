<li><a href="accidents/bham_pipeline.pdf">Pipeline Rupture and Subsequent Fire in Bellingham, Washington, June 10, 1999</a>, courtesy of the National Transportation Safety Board.  A combination of damaged piping, SCADA system troubles, a faulty pressure relief valve, and human error caused approximately 237,000 gallons of gasoline to spill into a creek running through the center of a city.  The gasoline fumes found an ignition source, igniting the creek and causing deaths and considerable damage along the creek's banks.</li>
<li><a href="accidents/PAR0402_strappingtable.pdf">Pipeline Accident Report -- Storage Tank Explosion and Fire in Glenpool, Oklahoma</a>, courtesy of the National Transportation Safety Board.  A combination of excessive flow rate and an errant strapping table (tank-volume-to-liquid-height function) led to the explosion of a fuel tank as it was being filled from an empty condition.</li>
<li><a href="accidents/NTSB_diesel_pipeline_rupture.pdf">Pipeline Accident Brief -- diesel pipeline rupture, Murfreesboro, Tennessee</a>, courtesy of the National Transportation Safety Board.  Incorrect operating procedure, partially caused by an incorrect graphic display on the SCADA system, caused this pipeline to rupture from excessive liquid pressure.</li>
<li><a href="accidents/Ammonia_pipeline_rupture_pressure_alarms.pdf">Pipeline Accident Brief -- Ammonia pipeline rupture in Kingman, Kansas</a>, courtesy of the National Transportation Safety Board.  A rupture in a liquid ammonia pipeline spanning six states is detected by pressure and rate-of-pressure-change alarms.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Petroleum production and refining</b></li>
<li><a href="accidents/Sonat_oil_gas_production_separator_overpressure.pdf">Investigation Report -- catastrophic vessel overpressurization</a>, courtesy of the US Chemical Safety Board.  This report followed the 1998 Sonat Exploration separation facility in Pitkin, Louisiana.  Here, a pair of manual bypass valves were left shut when they should have been open, explosing a third-stage separator vessel to high pressure when it was designed to operate only at atmospheric pressure.</li>
<li><a href="accidents/CSBFinalReportBP.pdf">Investigation Report -- refinery explosion and fire</a>, courtesy of the US Chemical Safety Board.  This report followed the 2005 BP oil refinery explosion in Texas City, Texas.  Here, a large vapor cloud from an Isomerization unit start-up problem ignited, immediately killing fifteen people and injuring almost two hundred, and causing extensive damage to the refinery.  The factors leading to this explosion included poor operating procedures, faulty instrumentation, and human error.</li>
<li><a href="accidents/CSBFinalReportValeroSunray.pdf">Investigation Report -- LPG fire at Valero-McKee refinery</a>, courtesy of the US Chemical Safety Board.  This report followed the 2007 Valero oil refinery fire in Sunray, Texas.  A rupture in a ``dead leg'' section of piping led to a serious propane fire, resulting in four deaths, a total refinery evacuation, and extended shutdown.  The ``dead'' piping section had not been blinded, but was isolated only by manual valves, one of which was not sealing properly.</li>
<li><a href="accidents/Motiva_Final_Report_bubbler_inertcovergas.pdf">Investigation Report -- Motiva Enterprises</a>, courtesy of the US Chemical Safety Board.  This report followed the 2001 acid storage tank rupture in Delaware City, Delaware.  The tank's ``inerting'' system designed to displace air with carbon dioxide, failed to do its job which led to an internal explosion.</li>

This report followed the 2004 Formosa Plastics Corporation polyvinylchloride (PVC) manufacturing accident in Illiopolis, Illinois.  Operator error was the primary cause of this accident, where an operator drained a pressurized reactor (rather than the shut-down reactor he intended to drain).  Provisions for manually bypassing the safety interlocks likely led to this accident.</li>
<li><a href="accidents/Synthron_runaway_reaction_cooling.pdf">Case Study -- runaway chemical reaction and vapor cloud explosion</a>, courtesy of the US Chemical Safety Board.  This report followed the 2006 incident at a Synthron chemical processing facility in Morganton, North Carolina.  A batch reaction process was overloaded with material, resulting in more heat generated than the cooling system could remove.  This overpressured the reactor, releasing a cloud of flammable vapor which then exploded.</li>
<li><a href="accidents/T2_final_report.pdf">Investigation Report -- T2 Laboratories, Inc. Runaway Reaction</a>, courtesy of the US Chemical Safety Board.  This report followed the 2007 incident at a chemical facility in Jacksonville, Florida producing an octane-boosting gasoline fuel additive.
