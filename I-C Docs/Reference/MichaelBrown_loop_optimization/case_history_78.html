                <p style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-size: small;">Problems in the control of steel reheat furnaces (continued)</span></b></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In
the previous article in this Case Histories series, which was published
2 months ago, some of the control problems encountered on the first
visit to optimise two reheat furnaces in a steel plant were
described.&nbsp;It will be remembered that on that visit only open loop
tests were performed on simple cascade secondary flow loops to
establish valve problems, and in fact very serious problems were
encountered.&nbsp;This article continues with some of the problems
found on the second visit to finish optimising the controls.&nbsp;In
the intervening period, the valves had been serviced, and the controls
had been changed over to the new PLC system.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Although
most of the loops were optimised reasonably successfully during the
second visit, many problems were still encountered with the valves, and
also several process problems. Some of the more interesting ones are
covered here.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure
1 shows an open loop step test on the furnace pressure control.&nbsp;It
should be noted that the process gain (ratio of change in PV to change
in PD) is about 0.2 which is very small.&nbsp;This means that
relatively large changes on the controller output result in only very
small changes in pressure.&nbsp;In this case the implication is that
the pressure can only be controlled over a very small limited
range.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">
                    <table nof="TE" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
                        <tbody><tr>
                            <td align="center"><img id="Picture53" src="case_history_78_files/cashis78Fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" title="Figure 1" border="0" height="408" width="550"></td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody></table>
                    </span></p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 1</span></i></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Also
of interest are the large regular fluctuations of pressure of about 20%
amplitude, with a period of about 110 seconds.&nbsp;The reason for this
is the opening and closing of doors to push billets out of the
furnace.&nbsp;There is no way that the feedback control can be tuned
fast enough to catch these fluctuations. </span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Temperature
in the various zones are also effected by furnace pressure, but cannot
vary fast enough to follow the pressure cyclic fluctuations in any
significant way.</span>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
pressure is in fact quite a fast loop, so tuning the pressure
controller in the normal way would have resulted in the controller
trying to aggressively compensate for the fluctuations, which would
have resulted in extreme shortening of the valve life.&nbsp;Therefore a
special tuning was used consisting of almost purely integral only
control, which effectively "averages" out the fluctuations and attempts
to keep the average pressure at setpoint.&nbsp;This is quite a slow
tune, but it worked quite effectively as can be seen in the step change
of setpoint test shown in the closed loop test in Figure 2.&nbsp;It can
be seen that the tuning is relatively slow but does keep the average
pressure at setpoint, and it certainly does work relatively well.</span></p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure
3 is an open loop test on the temperature control in the Preheat Zone
on one of the furnaces.&nbsp;One can see how well the pressure kept to
its setpoint even under the large load changes being caused by step
changes in the gas and air flow loops being made during the test.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">
                    <table nof="TE" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

                <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 3</span></i></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In
addition one can also see a severe stick-slip cycle on the gas flow
loop.&nbsp;Stick-slip cycles have been described quite a few times in
previous articles.&nbsp;To summarise they are due to a valve problem
and NOT to bad tuning, as many people seem to believe.&nbsp;The result
is that we often find loops suffering from this problem terribly
detuned, which results in very bad control.&nbsp;Although such cycles
are not nice, it is better to tune the cascade secondary flow loop fast
so that good temperature control can be achieved.&nbsp;Even with the
stick-slip cycle, the average flow through the valve meets the
temperature controller's demand requirements.&nbsp;(Stick-slip cycles
can of course best be eliminated by slowing the integral down over a
small gap around setpoint &#8211; see Loop Signature article no. 8).</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">An open loop test on the heating zone of one the furnaces is shown in Figure 4.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    <table nof="TE" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

                    </tbody></table>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Figure 4</i></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This
displays extremely interesting dynamics in the temperature response to
a step test in the PD.&nbsp;The initial response in temperature is very
fast, and then it slows down and starts ramping.&nbsp;This is sometimes
referred to as "a positive lead integrator".&nbsp;What actually occurs
is that when the step change is made on the demand, the sudden increase
in combustion causes an initial fast rise of temperature directly in
the ambient temperature inside the furnace.&nbsp;However the furnace
load and walls are also starting to absorb heat and their temperature
starts ramping up, which results in the overall temperature in the
furnace also ramping up in an integrating fashion.&nbsp;This type of
process requires a very special type of tuning which will be dealt with
in a future issue in the Loop Signature series.&nbsp;If tuned
correctly, normally spectacular improvements in performance are
obtained, as compared to the original tuning usually encountered with
this type of process dynamics. </span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure
5 shows the temperature response to a setpoint change in a&nbsp;closed
loop test on the same loop.&nbsp;This is really excellent, and shows
just how good the tuning is.&nbsp;It is very, very much better than the
original "as found" tuning which literally took about 50 times longer
to respond to a step change of setpoint of the same magnitude.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">
                    <table nof="TE" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

                <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 5</span></i></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Something
of interest that can be seen in the figure is the airflow response when
the setpoint is stepped down.&nbsp; It goes into a very short term
cycle.&nbsp;However it does not do that when the setpoint is stepped
up, and the response is very stable.&nbsp; This was in fact caused by
an instability problem in the valve positioner.&nbsp;Even with this
problem, the temperature control worked fine, once again proving the
power of cascade control systems.&nbsp;If the temperature controller
had been connected directly to the really poorly performing air and gas
valves, it would only have been impossible to have such fine control.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure
6 shows an open loop test on a temperature control loop in one of the
other zones in the same furnace.&nbsp; In the test the controller
output is moved from zero to 93%.&nbsp;The actual change in temperature
over that range was a mere 2% of span which was equivalent to 20ºC
movement.&nbsp;This shows there is a major process problem in this
zone, and the temperature is effectively uncontrollable.</span></p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
last and very interesting example which is shown in Figure 7 is of a
gas flow loop.&nbsp;The valve which had purportedly been serviced
between the two visits, was behaving even more badly on the second
visit.&nbsp;In the figure one can see that the valve actually reversed
direction whilst being opened!&nbsp;On reversing the controller output
and trying to close the valve the valve more or less stuck at the same
position for quite a while, and then suddenly opened further before
starting to close.&nbsp;It is absolutely impossible to try and achieve
any sort of control with a valve like this.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
above examples are typical of the many control problems and challenges
found in the average plant.&nbsp;It still amazes me that people are
generally not aware of these things, and very few plants make any
effort at all to even try and make their control systems operate
properly, in spite of the fact that those control systems cost them a
huge amount&nbsp;of capital.</span></p>
