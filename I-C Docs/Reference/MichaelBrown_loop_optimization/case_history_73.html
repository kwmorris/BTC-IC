                <p><b><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Control Loop Case History 73</span></b></p>
                <p><b>Hope for the teaching of practical control</b><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br><br>In
many of my previous articles I have highlighted the fact that the vast
majority of control practitioners have no real understanding of the
practical aspects of regulatory control.&nbsp;They have found that they
have been unable to apply the highly theoretical teachings taught to
them by the educational institutions they attended, and as a result
they have learnt their craft by "trial and error".&nbsp;In these
articles I have also attached blame to these institutions and have
commented they are not teaching the practical side, and in fact appear
to have no interest in doing so.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Various
people have responded to these articles, and have also expressed their
concern about the lack of knowledge displayed by people working in this
field.&nbsp;However in the July issue of the South African
Instrumentation and Control magazine, Dr Maurice McDowell writing on
this subject queried if it is the function of educational institutions
to teach the practical side.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This
has made me think long and hard.&nbsp;It takes me back to the first day
of the second year of my studies in Electrical Engineering at the
University of the Witwatersrand, which was the first time we actually
started learning truly engineering subjects.&nbsp;Our lecturer began
the session by stating that if we thought we had come to university to
learn engineering then we had thought wrong.&nbsp;He then commented
that what we would learn at university would be to think like
engineers.&nbsp;The actual engineering knowledge would be learnt later.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This turned out to be very true.&nbsp;Most of our studies had very little to do with practical engineering.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">On
reflection I now also think that teaching practical control techniques
in an entirely academic environment like a university would be
difficult, as one could not immediately go out and practice the
learning in an actual plant.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I
have very little knowledge about the teachings given at Technikons and
other similar institutions where they teach control, but I have always
assumed that they would teach a more practical approach, and thought
that they would combine much more practice with the theory than do
Universities.&nbsp;However in general I have had just as little
interest from them about my ideas on practical control as I have from
university academia.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I
am certainly aware that very few people in the academic side in control
have much field experience, which is possibly why they may be reluctant
to talk to me.&nbsp;I do know that for many years it has been
impossible for academic institutions to get experienced people back
from industry to lecture.&nbsp;My tutor, the late and revered Professor
Bozzoli, Dean of Electrical Engineering, and subsequently Vice
Chancellor of the University of the Witwatersrand, once told me that
there was virtually no chance of a graduate ever returning to teach,
once he or she had left university to work in industry,.&nbsp;Apart
from the salary situation, it is very difficult to go back to the
"ivory tower".&nbsp; For this reason most lecturers are graduates or
post-graduates who had never practised in a real plant for any extended
period.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In
his article Dr McDowell then raised the question as to who should be
responsible for training people on the practical aspects on control,
and postulated that it is probably the responsibility of
industry.&nbsp;This is not a new idea.&nbsp;A new graduate needs a
certain amount of practical experience before he can apply for the
status of a Professional Engineer.&nbsp;When I graduated in the early
1960's, a graduate in the United Kingdom had to undergo what was termed
a 2-year "graduate apprenticeship" before he or she could practice
professionally as an engineer.&nbsp;(I do not know if this still
applies today).</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Although
I studied in South Africa, I thought at the time that a graduate
apprenticeship would be an excellent idea.&nbsp;Unfortunately the
company I went to in the UK, although very large and prosperous, had a
very poor graduate apprenticeship-training scheme, which was
furthermore hampered by problems with trade unions.&nbsp;This meant
that the apprentices were not allowed to do anything that was
"proscribed" union work.&nbsp;This effectively meant that you could do
nothing except some of the most menial tasks.&nbsp;The local graduate
apprentices referred to it as a "post graduate boredom" and said you
just had to sit it out.&nbsp;This was a complete waste of 2 years of
what should be amongst the most fruitful in a young engineer's
career.&nbsp;(As it was it actually took me nearly a year to get myself
transferred into a permanent position in a department whose work
interested me).&nbsp;It still hurts me to think of all the talent in
that company that was wasted for two years.&nbsp;So my own practical
learning only came much later.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In
my experience very few companies except some of the largest have any
formalised practical training for graduates.&nbsp;Therefore the only
way most people can learn the practical skills is by picking them up
"on the job", mostly learning from more experienced practitioners in
that field.&nbsp;Now this presents a major problem when it comes to
regulatory control, because the really vast majority of people
including very experienced individuals do not have knowledge of the
practical side, which has never been taught to them in the first
place.&nbsp;Their own "skills" have been learnt mostly by trial and
error, and much of that "learning" has given them instincts which are
often wrong.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I
have mentioned many times in the past that it is an amazing fact of
life to me that in 99.99% of all plants optimisation of control loops
has never been treated as a separate discipline.&nbsp;This is because
of the complete state of ignorance of this subject, the general
acceptance of the performance of controls over the years, and the fact
that very few people are interested enough to evaluate what almost
unbelievable paybacks and opportunities could be achieved if the base
layer controls in nearly every plant worked properly.&nbsp;Most people
do not know how to judge the performance of a control loop.&nbsp;Often
the fact that it is in automatic is taken as a sign of satisfactory
performance.&nbsp;Therefore there is little interest, and in most
plants optimisation is thought of as "tuning", which is often left to
lower level disciplines, where the people have even less idea on how to
go about it.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">As
there is so little awareness on the need for optimisation, it is
unlikely that either industry or educational institutions will ever be
interested enough to institute a formal training programme on practical
control.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">How
does one try and raise this awareness?&nbsp;I have been trying to do so
for years, with unfortunately very limited success.&nbsp;Many companies
have shown an interest, and sent delegates on my
courses.&nbsp;Unfortunately even though the trainees themselves usually
go back with marked enthusiasm, they very seldom ever get any
management support, and pressures are put upon them to perform other
purportedly more important tasks.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I
have come to the definite conclusion that any optimisation effort is
doomed to failure without really enthusiastic support and commitment
from both top and middle management.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Two
things have occurred in recent years which could spell some hope for
raising the awareness.&nbsp;The first of these is that there is a big
move afoot worldwide for plants to install advanced control systems. To
site an example a year ago, the Chairman of one of South Africa's
biggest industrial giants stated in his annual financial report that
the future of his company lay in the successful implementation of
advanced control systems over the next decade.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Now
advanced control systems have been around for quite a long time, but it
has become apparent to most experienced advanced control engineers that
most installed systems have not worked optimally, mainly due to the
poor performance of the "base layer", i.e. the regulatory
controls.&nbsp;In fact one of the leading advanced control engineers in
the South African mining industry recently commented that installation
of an advanced control systems has generally only resulted in a very
expensive method of "propping up" a poorly optimised base layer.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Many
of these advanced control people are now pushing for properly optimised
regulatory controls.&nbsp;Again the problem is that they do not seem to
be able to get the support of the top management who find it very hard
to believe that their regulatory control systems which cost them
multi-millions, and have been working for years, are not operating
properly, and that more money and people must be invested to get them
working better.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The
second ray of hope which I think may really come into its own, is the
fact that a relatively new product generally known as a "loop
performance monitor", is now available in the market.&nbsp;This device
can monitor the performance of all the control loops simultaneously in
a plant, and can relatively quickly and easily highlight most of those
that are not performing properly.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A
local manufacturer of a very good&nbsp;loop performance monitoring
system, has been installing them in on a 60 day trial basis in
plants.&nbsp;The results have been absolutely staggering.&nbsp;In every
plant where they have done this to date, the results have shown
overwhelmingly how badly most loops are performing.&nbsp;Even the
biggest sceptic in these plants has been forced to realise that
something needs to be done to correct the situation.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Certain
personnel in one plant stated that they were aware of these problems,
but there was no cure for them because of the nature of the
processes.&nbsp;To test this hypothesis, the Production Manager got me
in for a day to investigate several of the worst and most important
loops.&nbsp;The result of this was to prove that all of the loops could
operate very much better if proper practical control principles were
applied.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I
must warn that people in plants should not put too much reliance on
loop performance monitors to show up all the problems.&nbsp;They can
certainly pick up many, but not all, of the problem loops, and quite a
few might be missed whose performance could be substantially
improved.&nbsp;The reasons for poor loop performances are also
generally not shown up.&nbsp;Therefore the monitors by themselves can
not eliminate the need for a proper optimisation exercise to be
performed.&nbsp;Loops performance monitors must therefore be regarded
as a very important tool in optimisation, but not as the only
tool.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The
"half life" of an optimisation exercise is generally in the region of 6
- 12 months.&nbsp;This is where a loop performance monitor really come
into its own, because once the controls have been properly optimised,
the monitor will then immediately flash a warning if any loop's
performance deteriorates.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I
believe these devices will play a very significant part in firstly
convincing people of the need to optimise their controls, and secondly
in acting a "watchdog" for performance degradation once the loops have
been optimised.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Once
people really understand the benefits of a properly optimised base
layer there should be sufficient impetus for companies to ensure that
their people do understand the practicalities of control, and put
pressure on the relevant educational institutions to teach these skills.</span></p>
