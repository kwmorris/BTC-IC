                <p><b>10. DYNAMICS OF SIMPLER PROCESSES</b></p>
                <p><b>Pure deadtime, self-regulating process</b></p>
                <p>In the <a href="http://www.controlloop.co.za/Loop_signatures/Loop_Signatures_P2-9/loop_signatures_p2-9.html">previous article</a>
in this series, the tuning of a simple first order lag, deadtime,
self-regulating process was discussed. The transfer function of such a
process is: </p>
                <p><img id="Picture2" src="loop_signatures_p2-10_files/loopsig2-10_eq1.gif" alt="loopsig2-10 eq1" title="loopsig2-10 eq1" align="top" border="0" height="64" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="160"></p>
                <p>The term "controllability factor" was defined in a previous article as <b>DT/TC</b>,
and it was mentioned that the larger it gets, the more difficult it is
to control, and as it gets smaller, the easier the control. A deadtime
dominant process is defined as one where the deadtime is greater or
equal to the time constant.</p>
                <p>As a general note many, if not most of the tuning packets and methods can only work on processes that are not deadtime dominant.</p>
                <p>The
example in the previous article was for a controllability factor less
than unity.&nbsp; In this article and the next, we will look at cases
where the controllability factor is at either of the two extremes. In
this one we will deal with a process where the factor is infinity.
Effectively this is a process with zero lags.&nbsp; I have called it "a
pure deadtime self-regulating process".</p>
                <p><img id="Picture3" src="loop_signatures_p2-10_files/loopsig2-10_eq2.gif" alt="loopsig2-10 eq2" title="loopsig2-10 eq2" align="top" border="0" height="27" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="114"></p>
                <p>I
have read quite a few articles and textbooks where the authors state
that that such a process cannot be controller with a PID
controller.&nbsp; Possibly this is true if the "D" term is used, but it
definitely can be controlled by a PI controller.</p>
                <p>There
are in fact special deadtime controllers on the market, often referred
to as model predictive controllers, and one in particular, called the
"Smith Predictor", is well known.&nbsp; Most of these try and cancel
out the deadtime by inserting a delay block in the feedback leg. I have
never yet met anyone who has had much success with such controllers.
One consulting control engineer at one of the UK's largest steel
companies told me that he has tried them on quite a few occasions, and
that the problem he found was that the process' dynamics change around
too much, so the model is no good.</p>
                <p>In
practice it would be almost impossible to exactly find a
self-regulating process with only a gain and a deadtime in a real
plant, as nearly all processes will also have some other additional
response like a lag or a ramp.&nbsp; However I have come across some
controls on conveyor belt feeders where the deadtime is so much larger
than any other dynamics like lags and ramps, so that they can be
considered as pure deadtime self -regulating processes.</p>
                <p>Figure
1 illustrates such a dynamic with a process gain of 1, and a deadtime
of 20 seconds.&nbsp; This is quite an interesting process in practice,
as the PV (process variable) exactly follows every movement of the PD
(controller output) one deadtime later.</p>
                <p><img id="Picture4" src="loop_signatures_p2-10_files/loopsig2-10Fig1.jpg" alt="loopsig2-10Fig1" title="loopsig2-10Fig1" align="top" border="0" height="445" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 1</i></p>
                <p>The
Bode open plots shown in Figure 2 are also very interesting. The gain
plot (on the bottom) is a line running horizontally from low frequency
and stops when the phase lag (top curve) reaches -180º.&nbsp; In the
previous article on the example with the controllability factor less
than one, the Bode gain plot dropped off due to the lag in the process
and ended off at -180º phase lag with a slope of &#8211;20db/decade.</p>
                <p><img id="Picture5" src="loop_signatures_p2-10_files/loopsig2-10Fig2.jpg" alt="loopsig2-10Fig2" title="loopsig2-10Fig2" align="top" border="0" height="443" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 2</i></p>
                <p>This
is certainly quite serious from the tuning point of view, because it
means that the proportional gain in the controller must be severely
reduced in order to allow sufficient gain margin for safety when the
loop is in automatic. It must also be noted that the D term must not be
used, as it will lift up the right hand side of the plot even further.
(When it comes to deadtime dominant processes the D term does stand for
"DO NOT USE").</p>
                <p>Figure
3 shows the Bode closed loop gain plot with a Protuner tuning of P =
0.23 and I = 6.4 seconds/repeat. It can be seen that the shape is not
perfect pole cancellation, with a slight upward bend on the right hand
side. This means that theoretically the response will be slightly
slower than ideal.</p>
                <p><img id="Picture6" src="loop_signatures_p2-10_files/loopsig2-10Fig3.jpg" alt="loopsig2-10Fig3" title="loopsig2-10Fig3" align="top" border="0" height="443" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 3</i></p>
                <p>The
actual control response to a setpoint step change with this tuning is
shown in Figure 4. It is in fact really excellent, with the process
reaching setpoint in roughly two deadtimes.&nbsp; (The Protuner does in
fact contain some special "tricks" when it comes to tuning deadtime
dominant processes, and as quite a lot of control people will attest,
there are many such processes, previously always in manual, now running
in automatic thanks to this tuning ability).</p>
                <p><img id="Picture7" src="loop_signatures_p2-10_files/loopsig2-10Fig4.jpg" alt="loopsig2-10Fig4" title="loopsig2-10Fig4" align="top" border="0" height="442" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 4</i></p>
                <p>Figure
5 shows the response to a step change in setpoint with a Ziegler
Nichols tuning which gives P = 0.45 and I = 33.2 seconds/repeat. It is
not good at all, and is many times slower than the Protuner's
tuning.&nbsp; However to be completely fair, Ziegler and Nichols did
say in their article on their tuning methods, that they did not know
how to deal with deadtime dominant processes.</p>
                <p><img id="Picture8" src="loop_signatures_p2-10_files/loopsig2-10Fig5.jpg" alt="loopsig2-10Fig5" title="loopsig2-10Fig5" align="top" border="0" height="444" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 5</i></p>
                <p>To
conclude it can be definitely said that reasonable tuning can be
obtained on very deadtime dominant processes using P+I controllers.
However the controller does have to be detuned (P gain reduced) for
stability. Derivative should never be used on such processes. In
general the main problem found with such processes is when load changes
occur too frequently to catch with the possible tuning.&nbsp; In such
cases alternative control strategies must be considered.</p>
