                <p style="text-align: left;">I
recently received an enquiry from the instrument and control engineer
on an Australian mine who has been having fairly severe problems trying
to control the pH in his flotation plant.&nbsp;He has requested that
his name be withheld, and for the article I will give him the
fictitious name of Tom.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><b><i>This is Tom's email to me:</i></b></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Feed water pH control</b></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">It
should be noted that in order for the frother and collector to be
chemically efficient the pH of the water that the reagents are dosed
into has to be tightly controlled. </p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">The
circuit I am using is as follows. The water circuit in is as seen in
Figure 1.4. From said circuit it should be noted that the water
returning from the dam is very acidic and that the thickener overflow
water is fairly neutral. It should also be noted that in order for the
reagents dosed at the flotation circuit to operate effectively the pH
of the solution in said circuit had to be between 8.5 and 9.0 </p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><img id="Picture9" src="case_history_85_files/cashis85_fig102.jpg" alt="cashis85 fig102" title="cashis85 fig102" align="top" border="0" height="402" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="657"></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Figure 1.4</b></p>
                <p>My
first attempt at controlling the Mill Water Return Sump (MWRS) was a
simple pH control algorithm that operated as per Figure 1.5. A pH probe
and transmitter (A) and a control valve (D) were fitted to the MRWS.
The output from this transmitter was used as the measured variable in a
two-term controller. Depending on the controller setpoint (B) an output
was sent to a lime dosing valve and the pH in the sump maintained at
the required value.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately
I found it to be exceedingly difficult to maintain the required pH
levels at the flotation circuit.&nbsp; Having looked at the dosing
circuit I realised that the MWRS which was basically being used as
Reaction Vessel&nbsp;(i.e. the vessel in which the reaction between the
process stream and reagent, in this case lime, takes place) was not
large enough. In fact the required reaction was taking place as the
water passed through the pipes enroute to the floatation bank. Simple I
thought I will either increase the size of the MRWS or improve
agitation in the vessel and that will be the end of my problems.
Unfortunately both these options would involve plant down time and
would also require a fair amount of capital.</p>
                <p><img id="Picture10" src="case_history_85_files/cashis85_fig202.jpg" alt="cashis85 fig202" title="cashis85 fig202" align="top" border="0" height="280" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="563"></p>
                <p>In
order to come up with an inexpensive but reliable solution I realised
that I would have to do some test work. Through a campaign of sampling
and dosing I was able to ascertain that the correct pH could be
achieved if my dosing control strategy was changed.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>Cascade control loop</b></p>
                <p>The control philosophy finally decided upon was a cascade system.</p>
                <p>The cascade control loop that I eventually employed is as seen in Figure 1.6.</p>
                <p>Controller
tuning proved difficult, however through a process of trial and error I
found that the master control loop had to be set to be much less
responsive than the slave, which was set to react rapidly to changes.
The reasoning behind this was that the master controller had to
compensate for the delay that existed between the reagent flow being
adjusted and the time it took for the chemical reaction as a result of
these adjustments to occur. </p>
                <p><img id="Picture11" src="case_history_85_files/cashis85_fig302.jpg" alt="cashis85 fig302" title="cashis85 fig302" align="top" border="0" height="254" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="468"></p>
                <p>Referring
to Figure 1.5 I divided the water circuit into two definite areas. The
first area was the MRWS where the neutralising reagent lime was dosed
and the second was the Flotation bank where flocculent was added. As
mentioned previously these flocculants only operated effectively within
a stable pH band. During test work I found that there could be large
differences between pH values measured at the MRWS compared to readings
taken at the flotation banks.&nbsp;This indicated to me that the lime
and water were still reacting with each other after they had left the
MRWS. (Precipitation was taking place in the pipes.) Bearing this in
mind I decided that by placing pH sensors in strategic points across
the water circuit i.e. the MRWS and the flotation banks I would be able
to come up with a vastly improved control strategy, maybe!!</p>

                <p><b><i>This is my reply to Tom</i></b></p>
                <p><b><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,Serif; font-size: 12pt;"></span></u></b>Dear Tom,</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Listing the possibilities that could affect your pH control:</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">1. One of the most basic and essential requirements for any pH control is that the reagent and product must be 
                    properly mixed before it reaches the pH sensor.&nbsp;You will have serious problems if it is not.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">2. Another problem I have encountered in similar applications is that the lime slaking solution process is 
                    sometimes not automated, and is performed manually, so that the lime solution pH itself varies.&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">3. Load variations caused by changes in the ore feed to the mill.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">4. pH load variations caused by other things being added into the milling circuit like dilution water).</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">5.
pH variations caused by different types of ore.&nbsp;(I am not sure how
much this could affect the pH, but I am trying to list all
possibilities).</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">6.
Various valve problems (e.g. non-linear installed characteristics,
hysteresis, etc.) in the lime solution dosing valve.&nbsp;Note that
valve problems cause 85% of all loop problems.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">7.
Incorrect controller set-up.&nbsp;(Typically about 75 &#8211; 80% of all
plants I have been in using PLC controllers have the controllers set-up
incorrectly so that scientific tuning is impossible).</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">8. Poor controller tuning.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">It
would appear based on the testing you have done, that the primary
problem is indeed that insufficient mixing is occurring.&nbsp;However
your original control loop had the pH probe inside the MWRS.&nbsp;This
was not a good spot for the reason given in point 1 above, particularly
as you say the agitation is not good..&nbsp;Ideally the measurement
should have been after the MWRS's pump outlet, probably at the inlet to
the mill, where you would have a much better chance of getting a truly
representative pH reading.&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">If
you do perform tests and find that the mixing is still not complete
there, then I imagine it would be complete after the transit of the
mixture through the mill, the mill sump, and then through the mill sump
pump.&nbsp;If so, you would be better off measuring the pH there (which
is probably the same as you are now doing by measuring it directly in
what I would assume is the first flotation tank).</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">The
disadvantage of this measuring point is that you dramatically
increasing the deadtime and lags which will be generated by the
residence time of the mill, which I assume may be extensive.&nbsp;It
will also possibly be affected by mill dilution water and any other
additions into the mill like returns, etc.&nbsp;With the slower
dynamics introduced by the mill, control tuning must perforce be
correspondingly slower, thus increasing the time to correct load
changes.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">If
you are getting significant load changes in the mill for the reasons
given above and if you are loosing a lot of money through poor pH
control in your flotation, and if you the mixing is not complete after
the MWRS, then I believe it is essential that you reconsider trying to
improve mixing in the MWRS.&nbsp;I would also specifically suggest
trying improving the agitation first, before going to the expense of a
larger vessel.&nbsp;If mixing is then fine , and then with a pH
measurement just after the MWRS's pump outlet, you should get
relatively better control as far as the pH of the water entering the
mill is concerned, as you only have the dynamics of the MWRS to take
into account when tuning.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">After that you could put a pH measurement into the first floatation tank feeding a master controller, just like 
                    you are currently doing, and then send the output to the setpoint of the MWRS pH controller.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">There
is however a disadvantage in cascade control of two slow systems like
yours as you have already discovered.&nbsp;This is because they are
interactive.&nbsp;Ideally the secondary loop should be at least 10
times faster than the primary.&nbsp;This is very unlikely to be the
case here.&nbsp;Therefore it will be necessary to tune the secondary as
fast as possible (but leaving sufficient robustness to avoid
instability if anything changes) and slow the tuning of the primary
down very dramatically.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Another
possibility is to leave the MWRS loop alone, and add a second "fine"
control, by injecting caustic solution, into the mill sump.&nbsp;(This
is assuming that satisfactory mixing could be achieved in the
sump).&nbsp;However this would need quite a lot more thinking about and
discussion.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">If
you don't have load changes happening quickly in the mill, which in
reality (and ideally) should not occur if you are milling at constant
load, then you will be better off with a single loop with the
measurement in the first flotation tank.&nbsp;The cascade will not help
that much, and will probably actually give slower control as the
primary controller has to be detuned.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">I
would also suggest you should also examine the other possible problem
causes listed above.&nbsp;If any of them are likely to be occurring in
your plant, then solutions to them will be found by studying my "Basic
Trouble Shooting and Loop Tuning" CD, which you are ordering.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Hope this helps.</p>
