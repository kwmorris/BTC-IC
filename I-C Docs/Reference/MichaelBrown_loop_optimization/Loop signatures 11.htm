      <P align=left>Figure 1 shows a simplified P only controller.&nbsp; The P 
      term may be considered as a pure amplifier that multiplies the input error 
      signal by whatever gain (Kp) is set in the controller to produce the 
      controller's output signal (PD).

      <P align=left>Figure 2 shows a recording of a test on a P only controller 
      with Kp = 4, with the controller mounted in the test rig as described in 
      Part 2 of this series.&nbsp; A setpoint (SP) change of 10% has been made, 
      which gives a step change of error of 10%, and the PD has immediately 
      stepped up by 40%.

      color=#000000 size=-1>As there are no standards in PID controllers, 
      manufacturers use various units for the P term.&nbsp; Probably the most 
      common is "gain", which as mentioned above is the amplifying factor, and 
      is defined as the size of the output step divided by the size of the input 
      step.
      <P align=justify>Another term used by quite a few manufacturers is 
      "proportional band".&nbsp; The relationship between gain and proportional 
      band is:
      <P align=justify>&nbsp; <B>Proportional Band = (1/Gain) x 100 %</B>
      <P align=justify>Proportional band is sometimes a useful concept in aiding 
      one in explaining controller responses, as it may be considered as a 
      graphical representation of the control range.&nbsp; This is illustrated 
      in Figure 3, where a gain of 2 has been entered in a P only 
      controller.&nbsp; The proportional band works out at 100/2 = 50%.&nbsp; 
      This can be drawn as a band of 50% width lying around the setpoint.&nbsp; 
      Note that the band need not be equidistant around the setpoint, but can in 
      fact move around the setpoint.&nbsp; However in ordinary controllers the 
      band normally can never move away from the setpoint.&nbsp; (The position 
      of where the setpoint lies within the band is in fact set by the value of 
      the bias).

      size=-1>Assume that at a particular moment of time the PV value was 
      sitting on the bottom edge of the proportional band.&nbsp; This would mean 
      that at that time the valve would be at one of its extremities, either 
      fully open or fully shut.&nbsp; If the measurement were then to move up to 
      the top of the proportional band, then the valve would have moved through 
      its range to the opposite extremity.
      <P align=justify>Thus the proportional band represents the control range, 
      as control can only be achievable between the two valve extremities.&nbsp; 

      <P align=justify>This leads to an interesting thought.&nbsp; In the first 
      article in this loop signature series, it was mentioned that control 
      performance or variance is a measure of error effectively totalised over a 
      period of time.&nbsp; If we were able to put more gain into a controller 
      and make the proportional band narrower, then it is feasible to believe 
      that the variance would improve, as errors should be smaller in a narrower 
      proportional band.&nbsp; Therefore the smaller the band, the better the 
      variance, provided we could in fact achieve control within that 
      band.&nbsp; 
      <P align=justify>Taking this concept to a ridiculous extreme we could 
      speculate that if we were to put an infinite gain into the controller, and 
      make the proportional band infinitely small (i.e. zero), then we should 
      have zero variance, as there should then be no control error.&nbsp; 
      Infinite gain is of course ON/OFF control, and as we know, ON/OFF control 
      is in fact in a continuous cycle, either switching the final control 
      element fully on or off, as the PV rises and falls through setpoint. This 
      results in very poor variance.
      <P align=justify>In reality as the gain is increased in the controller, 
      the loop will eventually start reacting to changes in setpoint or load 
      with a cyclic response, and this will get worse as the gain is increased.
      <P align=justify>Therefore for minimum variance there is a balance between 
      the amount of gain we can insert in a controller, and the amount of 
      cycling that we would be prepared to tolerate in any particular control 
      loop.&nbsp; The actual limit in practice would be where the gain in the 
      controller would give rise to a quarter damped amplitude response on a 
      step change in setpoint.
      <P align=justify>To explore the limitations inherent in a P only 
      controller, take the practical case of such a controller that is often 
      still encountered in level controls in plants.&nbsp; This is the ball 
      valve.&nbsp; 
      <P align=left>The ball valve and level process make up a complete feedback 
      control loop.&nbsp; The ball is the measuring element.&nbsp; The arm 
      connecting the ball to the valve is the proportional control mechanism, 
      and the valve the final control element.

      size=-1>Imagine the system illustrated in Figure 4 is being used for 
      controlling the level in the reservoir feeding water to our plant.&nbsp; 
      When we come to examine the system, let us imagine that we find that the 
      inflow and outflow are equal.&nbsp; The level is therefore constant at 
      some particular point.&nbsp; Let us call this point our desired level, the 
      setpoint.&nbsp; We then proceed to perform a little experiment, and open 
      the manual valve controlling the flow of water to our plant by 10%.&nbsp; 
      As the valve opens, the flow increases and the level starts 
      dropping.&nbsp; As it does so, the ball drops with it and opens up its 
      valve, which in turn increases the flow of inlet water.&nbsp; 
      <P align=left>Eventually the inflow will equal the outflow at which point 
      the level stops dropping, and will remain constant.&nbsp; The control 
      system is now in equilibrium, and the level will remain at the new value, 
      as long as no further changes are made to the manual valve.&nbsp; 
      <P align=left>The level is again under control, but is no longer at 
      setpoint, and we say that we are now controlling the level with an 
      "offset".
      <P align=left>Offset is the main drawback to P only control.&nbsp; There 
      is nothing in a P only controller that can do anything to permanently 
      eliminate the offset.&nbsp; For practical purposes one can generally 
      assume that a P only control system will almost definitely control with 
      offset at some stage or other.
      <P align=left>In certain instances one can tolerate a certain amount of 
      offset.&nbsp; However the majority control loops are there to keep the 
      process at the setpoint.
      <P align=left>The best one can do with a P only controller is to minimise 
      offset.&nbsp; This can be achieved in two ways.&nbsp; 
      <P align=left>Firstly if the controller gain is increased, the offset will 
      decrease proportionally.&nbsp; 
      <P align=left>Secondly, one can bring the process to the setpoint by 
      adjusting the valve position manually.&nbsp; In the example of the ball 
      valve above, one could physically bend up the arm between the ball and the 
      valve to allow the level to come back up to the setpoint.&nbsp; In a real 
      controller the same effect can be achieved by adjusting the bias.&nbsp; 
      This adjustment is often called "manual reset".
      <P align=left>The problem with manual reset is that if you had reset the 
      offset at a particular point in time, then when changes occurred in the 
      process again, another offset would result.&nbsp; In practice, manual 
      reset is used only for initially setting up P only control systems.
      <P align=left>In the real world of industrial process control, P only 
      control should only be used on processes that are tuned with a large P 
      gain value.&nbsp; It would generally be impossible to use it where the P 
      value is small, as large offsets could result.&nbsp; Therefore one 
      normally only finds P only controllers on integrating loops such as level 
      controls where high controller P gain is normal.
      <P align=left>Integrating loops are in actual fact better without the I 
      term in the controller.&nbsp; There are two reasons for this.&nbsp; The 
      first is that as mentioned in previous articles, any hysteresis on a valve 
      on an integrating process that is controlled with P+I control will result 
      in continuous cycling. The second reason is that the I term introduces a 
      second integral term into the combined loop process transfer function, and 
      prevents perfect pole cancellation tuning from being achieved.&nbsp; 
      Therefore the only reason that one should technically ever use the I term 
      in the controller on an integrating process, is if the possible offset is 
      unacceptable. However, in reality, most people don't like processes being 
      controlled with offset, even if it is actually acceptable, and as a result 
      one finds that the I term is used on most integrating processes.</FONT>
