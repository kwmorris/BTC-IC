                <p><font face="Arial">During my career spanning close on 20
                years solely as a specialist in control loop optimisation, I
                have worked in most industries that employ regulatory controls.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>However living and working in <st1:place w:st="on">
                Southern Africa</st1:place>
                which contains several countries rich in mines, it is
                understandable that I should have performed a great deal of my
                work in the mining industry.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>One of the things that I have learnt is that control
                systems in this industry have their own unique problems, and I
                have expanded on this specifically in Case History articles 68,
                91, 102, and 103.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </font></p>
                <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial">During the past year I
                have been particularly busy optimising controls in Concentrator
                plants on several platinum mines.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Whilst working in these plants I have been privileged to
                work alongside some extremely competent metallurgists.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>As a result I have managed to learn a fair deal about
                various processes, and specifically on understanding the control
                needs and problems associated with them.</font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><font face="Arial">One
                of the most difficult areas to control in metal extraction
                processes are the flotation banks.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>These are to be found in a wide range of different metal
                extraction plants, including platinum group metals,.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>To give a very basic and simplistic description of the
                process, the slurry coming from the milling section of the plant
                is mixed with a &#8220;frothing&#8221; reagent, and passed through a
                series of large tanks or <a name="OLE_LINK1">cells</a>, (refer
                Figure 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In each
                of these cells, air is bubbled through the mixture, and the
                valuable components of the products adhere to the bubbles, and
                rise to the surface forming a layer of froth, whilst the waste
                product remains behind in the liquid phase below the froth
                layer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The froth
                containing the products floats off at the top of the tank, and
                the remaining liquid gravitates out through a valve into the
                next cell, and the process is repeated down the bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Some banks can contain many cells.</font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img src="case_history_105_files/Fig_1.jpg" width="751" height="481" border="0"><font face="Arial"><br>
                <i>Fig. 1</i><o:p>

                </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><font face="Arial">There
                are two controls associated with each cell, namely level and air
                flow control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
                purpose of the level control is to keep the liquid phase in the
                cell at a very constant level, and the airflow is to control the
                amount of froth and bubble size.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>In earlier days the level control was considered to be of
                the most importance, but over the past few years it has been
                realised that the air flow is also critical.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The importance of these controls from the economic aspect
                cannot be overemphasised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
                profitability of the extraction process is largely dependant on
                efficient flotation.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><font face="Arial">The
                actual metallurgical aspects of flotation are in fact very
                complex.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much
                research has been done into trying to improve flotation
                efficiency, and an internet search on the subject results in
                many thousands of hits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many
                mines have or are now installing sophisticated advanced control
                systems (APC &#8211; Advanced Process Control systems).<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>However efficient recovery even with APC still boils down
                to efficient operation of the two controls of airflow and level.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><font face="Arial">From
                the control point of view the level control is the more
                difficult for many reasons, and a future article will discuss
                the basic aspects of this control.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Flow control is a relatively simple process, and
                consequently one would expect the airflow controls to be
                relatively problem free.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However
                the experience of myself and several other people has shown that
                the airflow control installed in the vast majority of flotation
                banks are operating unbelievably badly, and I will concentrate
                only on this subject in this article.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><font face="Arial">Control
                of flow is probably the simplest of all feedback control
                systems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has fast
                dynamics, and should not present any problems at all if the flow
                transmitter and control valve work properly.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Therefore I am amazed that these controls are working so
                badly on most of the flotation banks I have worked on.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span><o:p>
                </o:p>
                </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><font face="Arial">The
                main problem appears to be with the control valves.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Initially I thought that possibly it was due to bad
                maintenance, but the same problems occur on new plants as well
                as old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also control
                valves in other plants on the same mines have not exhibited the
                same problems, so I have come to the conclusion that the valves
                being specified for this application are probably being sourced
                for cost rather than for performance, but it is amazing that
                same thing seems to occur on so many different mines, many of
                which belong to different mining groups.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><font face="Arial">Possibly
                it is a &#8220;hereditary&#8221; thing, as the airflow controls were in
                earlier days regarded as not being very important.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>However in these modern times, all metallurgists I have
                discussed this with are most concerned about the poor control of
                their airflows.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><font face="Arial">The
                other area of concern is the flow measuring instrument.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Again rather than using tried, tested, and accurate types
                of flow measuring transmitters, money is being &#8220;saved&#8221; by
                employing a much cheaper flow transmitter which works on a
                thermal system, where the flow is effectively proportional to
                the heat loss as the air passes over a heated element.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>This is not to say that very good and reliable thermal
                type flowmeters are not available on the market, but the ones
                being used on most of the flotation banks I have worked on, are
                a much cheaper version.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
                personally have not done any tests myself on these meters, but I
                do know of tests performed recently by one of the biggest mining
                groups on these meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
                results have shown that they are extremely inaccurate and are
                subject to drift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
                mining group is now budgeting to replace all their airflow
                meters with more accurate and reliable types.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>They are also currently carrying out detailed
                investigations on the control valves.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><font face="Arial">It
                certainly seems to be very silly to try and cut initial costs by
                using inferior equipment for controls that can make a huge
                difference to profitability for the plant.</font></p>

                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><font face="Arial">The
                first example here is shown in Figure 2.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It is a closed loop test (with good final tuning
                parameters in the controller) on a cell in a Rougher Float Bank,
                and shows the response to a setpoint change.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The open loop tests previously carried out (not
                illustrated here) had shown the valve had a massive 25%
                hysteresis on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
                is terrible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
                general guide line a valve should have an absolute maximum of 1%
                hysteresis. <o:p>
                </o:p>
                </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><font face="Arial">In
                the figure one can see how when the setpoint changed the valve
                (which had previously moved in the other direction) just stayed
                where it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
                controller output had to integrate through the 25%, before the
                airflow started to change.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
                takes quite a lot of time, and it can be realised that the
                control variance suffers, and it will not help in realising
                efficient flotation in response to setpoint changes from the
                advanced control system.</font></p>

                bad air flow control on a cell in the same bank as the previous
                example is given next.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Figure
                3 is the open loop test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
                shows two bad things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly
                a maximum airflow of only about 48% could be obtained with the
                valve fully open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
                may have been due to the fact that there was a partial blockage
                in the line or valve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another
                possibility is that the valve is undersized, which could be
                quite likely as the gain of the<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>was about 0.5 which can be seen in the test by the
                relative sizes of the steps on PV and PD.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>(Controller output).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </span>In my Loop Signature series of articles it was shown that
                process gain = <a name="OLE_LINK2">&#916;</a>PV/&#916;PD). <o:p>

                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><font face="Arial">The
                operators usually had the setpoint above 50%.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>This meant that the required flow could never be reached.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>If the valve was undersized, then a high limit should
                have been placed on the setpoint to prevent the operators from
                exceeding the maximum possible flow.</font></p>

                second really bad thing that can be seen from the test is the
                hysteresis on the valve which exceeded 10%.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The effect of this hysteresis on the control can be
                clearly seen in Figure 4, which shows how long it takes to
                reverse the valve with the controller in automatic.&nbsp;</font></p>

                third and last example is also of an airflow on a Rougher
                Cleaner float cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Figure
                5 shows a closed loop &#8220;as found&#8221; test which is a test with
                the as-found tuning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
                can be seen that it was absolutely terrible, and leaves one
                wondering how anyone can tune a loop so badly.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>There was virtually no control whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The open loop test has not been shown here, but it proved
                that the valve on this circuit had a massive 30% hysteresis!<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Almost unbelievable that such a thing can occur in a
                plant and that no one was aware of it.</font></p>

                final closed loop test after tuning is shown in Figure 6.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The tuning is a little &#8220;hot&#8221; resulting in a slight
                overshoot on a setpoint change.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It can be seen how the output of the controller has to
                work excessively to get through the hysteresis every time the
                valve has to reverse, and how relatively long it takes to do
                this even on a fast process like flow.<o:p>

                interesting aside on this, is that virtually every control
                school in the world apart from us, teaches people to tune
                controllers to give a quarter wave response on a setpoint
                change.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means
                reversing the valve at least 8 times every time it moves.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>This example shows just how completely impractical that
                would be on a valve with severe hysteresis.<span style="">&nbsp;

                summarise, it is quite scary that people are installing
                important plants for float applications with such inferior
                equipment and controls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
                would certainly handsomely pay mining groups to be aware of this
                and take steps to improve things.<span style="">&nbsp;
