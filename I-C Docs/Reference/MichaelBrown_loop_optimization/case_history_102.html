                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Its quite fascinating when it comes to
                control that most industries have their own peculiarities,
                differences, and particular problems.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>In certain industries such as chemical, petro-chemical,
                and pulp and paper, one generally finds fairly sophisticated
                control systems and strategies in place.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>In particular these plants generally purchase top makes
                of DCS&#8217;s, and use the very best control valves.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>This is probably due to the facts that many of the early
                famous control engineers came from these industries, and also of
                course that their control systems are recognised as being of the
                utmost importance.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">The electrical power industry really stands
                out when it comes to differences in approach to regulatory
                control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example
                one of the biggest and best known manufacturers of control
                systems has a completely unique approach to control in this
                industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I really
                believe that way back in early days of control development in
                the early 20<sup>th</sup> century; their power control group
                developed their own unique and completely different approach to
                control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
                control systems for the power industry are structured in such a
                way that is sometimes incomprehensible to me, and also to most
                of their users whom I have discussed this with.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>However the same manufacturer also makes control systems
                for other industries, and these are entirely conventional.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>I find this strange.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Industries such as steel and mining are in
                my opinion, generally amongst the least sophisticated when it
                comes to regulatory control.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>They mostly use less leading-edge control equipment like
                PLC/SCADA systems as opposed to DCS systems, and will try and
                get away with cheaper and less sophisticated valves like
                butterfly valves wherever possible.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>However in the mining industry in particular, it must be
                mentioned that one is very limited as far as valves are
                concerned, particularly when it comes to dealing with fluids
                like slurries, which are extremely abrasive.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>In these cases one is limited to relatively crude valves
                like Dart and pinch valves.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Because of this, there has been a tendency to rather use
                variable speed pumps in this application which offer markedly
                improved performances.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">I believe that the degree of success in
                control performance in any plant can be directly correlated to
                the amount of interest, knowledge, and understanding of
                regulatory control existing amongst the process and production
                experts and management in the plant.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>In most chemical and petro-chemical plants these people
                have generally had control included as a mandatory subject in
                their university training, so they do realise how important
                control is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However
                in, many other industries the process and production people who
                have not had this training often look at control as a sort of
                &#8220;necessary evil&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
                often regard it as of secondary importance, and many think that
                optimisation can be carried out by low level disciplines.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>As mentioned in many previous articles, the general
                fallacy exists that optimisation only means tuning, and in turn,
                that tuning will solve all problems.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">It is absolutely essential that any
                optimisation exercise needs teamwork and strong management
                support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Optimisation
                can be rarely carried out successfully purely by the efforts of
                the Control and Instrumentation (C&amp;I) Department.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It is essential they receive support and process guidance
                from production and process people who need to work with them to
                achieve the best results.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Process and production management and
                experts should attend a course on practical control so they can
                really understand all the aspects of optimisation.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>My experience has shown that their enthusiasm and support
                really dramatically increases after they have been on such
                courses, and in fact they often become the major driving force
                behind successful optimisation exercises.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>This is because they now have a good understanding of the
                practicalities of control and can now appreciate how much
                controls can really improve plant performance in numerous ways,
                and in particular make them less operator dependent.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">The process people in mining and steel
                plants are generally metallurgists who mostly have had little or
                no control training in their studies.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>This is probably one of the main reasons why the control
                systems in these industries are often less progressive than in
                some of the other industries previously mentioned.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Apart from lack of understanding of control
                amongst process personnel, the mining industry has its own
                particular problems brought about mainly by the harsh materials
                and conditions that exist in mining processes.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>I have written about these in several previous Case
                History articles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Living
                in <st1:country-region w:st="on">
                <st1:place w:st="on">
                South Africa</st1:place>
                </st1:country-region>
                I spend a large amount of my time working in mining plants, and
                I still find new problems in every plant.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>This makes my job very interesting and enjoyable.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Also due to the lack of knowledge, the process and
                production people are generally amazed at the improvements that
                are obtained after a successful optimisation exercise.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">On my first visit to the average mining
                plant, I generally find that virtually none of the control loops
                are operating reasonably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
                most cases where PLC&#8217;s are used for the control, the PID
                control blocks are set up incorrectly.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>On one mine which had been running for close on a decade,
                I actually found that none of the PID blocks were working at
                all, as the system integrator had written his own PID block
                which was completely incorrect.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>However I have previously written a lot about these
                things in other articles dealing specifically with digital PID
                control blocks.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">The examples in this article are taken from
                some optimisation work recently performed at a mine where the
                management has taken a decision to really try and improve
                control performance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
                was agreeably surprised to find that the mine was not using
                PLC&#8217;s for control, but had purchased a well known make of DCS.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>There was a choice between two PID blocks in the system,
                one called a &#8220;simple&#8221; controller, and a slightly more
                sophisticated one called a &#8220;universal&#8221; controller.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Once again it became immediately apparent
                that the people who had originally programmed the system for
                the, mine, had very little knowledge of practical control, and
                in particular of the operation of PID controllers and options
                available in sophisticated DCS systems.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">The first thing of note was that on each
                control block there was a choice of whether the response on
                setpoint change should be on error (SP-PV) which is a full
                &#8216;P+I+D&#8217; response, or on &#8216;P+I&#8217;, or on &#8216;I&#8217; only.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The default of the DCS was &#8216;I&#8217; only.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>(A full description of this is given in the digital
                controller section of my Part 1 Loop Signature articles, which
                is available on CD for people outside <st1:place w:st="on">
                Southern Africa</st1:place>
                ).</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Now an &#8216;I&#8217; only response is fine for
                control where you really don&#8217;t want to bump the process by
                making a step change in setpoint.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It allows the setpoint change to be accomplished really
                slowly with only integral action reacting to the change.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </span>However it is completely useless in cases where one would
                like a fast response to setpoint.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>In mining applications there are many cases where the
                Operator needs to make setpoint changes. An example of this is
                for varying plant throughputs. In many cases when using &#8216;I&#8217;
                only response on setpoint change, the control reaction to the
                change is so slow that the operator learns that it is much
                faster and easier to make changes in manual.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Apart from this there are cases where the
                setpoint is coming from a remote source such as in the case of
                ratio, or cascade control, or in cases where advanced control
                systems have been instituted.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Apart from this one of the most important things to be
                aware of is that no tuning at all can be accomplished with
                &#8216;I&#8217; only action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
                is because tuning can only really be tested properly by making
                step changes in setpoint, and if you make a step change in
                setpoint and see only &#8216;I&#8217; action, then you cannot see what
                is happening at all.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">In all plants where one finds all
                controllers left in a default &#8216;I&#8217; only response to setpoint
                change, <i style="">then you can immediately deduce that no successful tuning can ever have
                taken place in that plant!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>I
                have been in many plants including large petro-chemical
                refineries and paper mills, where this has been the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The amazing thing concerning this, is that very few
                people know about it, and even more amazing that the
                manufacturers of the control equipment don&#8217;t mention it in
                their manuals or training courses.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It literally &#8220;boggles&#8221; the imagination.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">The second thing that was of interest in
                this DCS system was that whilst the &#8220;universal&#8221; controller
                performed perfectly, the &#8220;simple&#8221; controller did not.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>When this controller was used it became immediately
                apparent that tuning parameters were not being executed properly
                in the controller.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">I always test the controller operation
                whenever I encounter controllers in PLC&#8217;s<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>so as to ensure they have been set-up properly.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>However normally DCS systems are so good this is not
                necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However
                in this case when the &#8220;simple&#8221; control block was tested, it
                was found that the proportional gain setting inside the
                controller was out by a factor of as much as 20%.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The problem was solved by changing over all blocks using
                the &#8220;simple&#8221; controller to the &#8220;universal&#8221; one.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It is hard to believe that a reputable manufacturer can
                turn out equipment with such a large basic error in it.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>You would surely believe that they would test the
                operation of a control block before releasing the software.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">The first example of a problem loop is of
                an important flow on a section of this plant.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>This was an air flow.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The air is used to help separate certain mineral
                components, and it is essential that the flow strictly followed
                setpoint with absolutely minimum variance.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">The operators were very unhappy with this
                loop and had difficulty in even trying to control it in manual.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Figure 1, which is an open loop test, explains why.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>In such a test the process variable (i.e. the flow in
                this case), should follow the steps in the controller output.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It can be clearly seen in the figure that this is not the
                case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The valve did
                not respond at all on some steps.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It is pretty obvious that the valve not only has large
                hysteresis, but even after it had gone through reversals in
                direction, it did not move freely and stuck frequently.</p>

                <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><i>Fig. 1</i></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Another serious problem exists insomuch
                that the valve is very badly oversized, as can be seen by the
                large movement of the PV compared with small steps on the PD
                (controller output).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Refer
                to a previous Loop Signature articles on process gain).<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Another indication of the oversize can be seen from the
                fact that the valve is operating far too low down.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Maximum flow is reached in the first 30% of valve
                opening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
                very bad for control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(A
                general &#8220;rule of thumb&#8221; for modulating control valves is
                that they should preferably operate under normal load conditions
                above 20% from the closed position.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Oversized valves amplify their problems on
                the PV, but even so it would appear that the valve besides being
                so sticky is also non-repeatable, as when the PD is at a
                particular value at several points in the test, the value of PV
                did not reach the same value, even though the valve had moved
                freely on the previous step.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">In any event, the valve was operating so
                badly, that any form of control would be impossible, until it
                was sorted out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
                was in fact recommended that the valve should be replaced with a
                smaller one.</p>
