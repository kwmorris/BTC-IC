      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>Digital controllers - 
      Part I<BR>Introduction to the "simple" PID controller </FONT></B><FONT 
      face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>
      <P>There is a commonly held belief in control circles, that all PID 
      controllers are similar, and relatively simple.&nbsp; This is a very 
      dangerous fallacy.&nbsp; Our experience has shown that the vast majority 
      of&nbsp; people in plants (even very experienced I&amp;C personnel), have 
      little real understanding of the controllers they use. 
      <P>Incorrect controller usage can, and has cost plants very dearly in 
      terms of time and money.&nbsp; For example, a plant in the UK recently 
      lost nearly £2,000,000 in under-production, simply because they did not 
      choose a more suitable option which was available as standard in their 
      DCS!&nbsp; Operators often make changes on control systems manually rather 
      than in automatic, because the controllers have not been configured 
      correctly for the application, even though they may have been reasonably 
      well tuned.
      <P>If you wish to optimise the controls in your plant to obtain the most 
      effective control, it is really essential that you really gain a full 
      understanding of your controllers.
      <P>The first and very important point to realise is that there is no such 
      thing as a standard PID controller.&nbsp; Each manufacturer produce their 
      controllers entirely the way they wish, and as a result their controllers 
      are different to those of any other manufacturer.&nbsp; Not only that, but 
      I have found that some controller manufacturers do not even have their own 
      proper internal&nbsp; standards, and every time a new version of the 
      controller software is released things may differ quite substantially from 
      earlier versions of that software.&nbsp; This is probably due to changes 
      in staff amongst the programmers who write the controller software.&nbsp; 
      Also it a sad thing, but one finds that even amongst some very reputable 
      manufacturers, the people who write the controller software, and also 
      those who produce the technical manuals on the controllers, often display 
      an alarming lack of knowledge of practical control themselves, so as a 
      result they do some really stupid things.&nbsp; This will be become 
      clearer as this series of loop signatures on controllers progresses.
      <P>It also amazes me that most manufacturers generally do not provide any 
      form of training so that their clients can understand and operate the 
      controllers correctly, and be able to choose and apply the options 
      available. As mentioned above, I believe it essential that people do 
      acquire an in-depth understanding of the operation of their controllers if 
      they are to successfully optimise their plants, but many manufacturers 
      appear to share the common belief that their controllers are a standard 
      simple thing, and that there is no need to provide training, or produce 
      decent technical manuals on these products.&nbsp; I was once told by the 
      chief training officer of one of the biggest companies making DCS control 
      systems, that their job was not to train people on how to use PID 
      controllers which any instrument and control person should already 
      understand, and he was quite offended when I said to him that their 
      controllers were different to any other make of controller, and that in 
      over 50 plants employing their DCS system, I had never yet met any of 
      their users who really understood the controllers.
      <P>One of the reasons for the lack of understanding of the basic PID 
      controller, is that the modern digital controller generally has a host of 
      complex features and options available which are important to understand, 
      if one is to use the controller to the best advantage.&nbsp; 
      <P>It is my intention to provide a fairly detailed and in-depth 
      explanation of controller operation and of the possible features and 
      options that may be available in them, in the following series of Loop 
      Signature articles. The subjects to be covered will include:
      <P>* Testing controller operation.<BR>* The controller algorithm 
      (equation) used to provide the PID action.<BR>* Digital implementation of 
      the PID algorithm.<BR>* The operation of each of the three controller 
      actions, P, I, and D.<BR>* Reset windup and its prevention (both internal 
      and external).<BR>* Controller scan rate.<BR>* The derivative filter.<BR>* 
      Controller responses to errors arising from setpoint changes, as opposed 
      to load changes.
      <P>Some controllers offer more features than others.&nbsp; In general at 
      the current stage of development, DCS systems usually offer many more 
      features and options than most PLC's, which (with a very few exceptions) 
      are normally very limited in the analogue regulatory control features they 
      offer.&nbsp; In a recent article I did mention why I personally find that 
      DCS systems are far better for regulatory control than PLC's, and will not 
      repeat these points here.&nbsp; However in retrospect, I think it fair to 
      point out that the people building PLC's on the whole have extremely 
      limited experience in regulatory control systems, as opposed to DCS 
      manufacturers who have in many cases been supplying such control equipment 
      for many decades.
      <P>The remarks above do come down pretty hard on the manufacturers, and it 
      is only fair to point out that the users themselves, on their side, often 
      are also lacking badly, as they generally display little interest in the 
      PID controllers they purchase.&nbsp; In fact, frequently in specifications 
      put out by prospective purchasers of control systems, which often contain 
      copious and detailed requirements of things like man-machine interfaces, 
      redundancy and hot back-up, and many other important things, one usually 
      finds very little about the PID controllers themselves.&nbsp; I believe it 
      is essential that users of control systems should acquaint themselves with 
      the "pros and cons" of the equipment that they are buying to run the 
      regulatory controls in their plants.&nbsp; To illustrate this point, I 
      will mention later in this series of articles the hard to believe, and 
      little known fact, that the majority of PID controllers in the world are 
      configured in such a way that it is virtually impossible to practically 
      tune derivative action into them.&nbsp; Even though D action is probably 
      only really effective in one in several hundred control loops,&nbsp; the D 
      term can increase speed of response by up to a factor of 4, if the right 
      process dynamics are present.&nbsp; If I was a control engineer in a plant 
      purchasing control equipment, I wouldn't dream of buying a controller that 
      would not allow me to properly use the D term in it.
      <P>Lack of knowledge about your controllers&nbsp; can cost you dearly in 
      terms of poor control and productivity.&nbsp; The following articles in 
      this Loop Signature series will explain why.
