      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>It is impossible in 
      this limited series of articles to go into great depth on all the various 
      subjects and problems that can be encountered.&nbsp; What I am attempting 
      to do here is to outline some of the practical problems, and some 'rules 
      of thumb' relating to final control elements that can affect control in 
      the real world.&nbsp; Most of the points specifically apply to 
      pneumatically actuated valves, but may well also be relevant to other 
      devices as well.&nbsp; It is also assumed that in the general term 'final 
      control element', we are talking about all the components involved, 
      including the I/P (current-to-pneumatic) converter, air pressure 
      regulators, valve actuator, the positioner, and the valve itself.
      <P>The actual purpose of the final control element is to regulate the flow 
      of the process fluid strictly in accordance with the dictates of the 
      controller output (PD).&nbsp; In other words the valve must move to a 
      position represented by the value of the PD.&nbsp; The faster and more 
      accurately the valve follows these dictates the better the control 
      variance becomes.&nbsp; 
      <P>The importance of the final control element cannot be 
      overestimated.&nbsp; Many people mistakenly believe that the valve is not 
      really critical to the control performance.&nbsp; Their thinking is that 
      if the PD tells the valve to move to a particular position, and if the 
      valve doesn't get right to that point, then what matter?&nbsp; There is 
      always the I (integral) term in the controller, the purpose of which is to 
      eliminate control error, so if the valve doesn't get to the right point 
      then the controller will keep moving its output until the valve does 
      actually get to the correct point.
      <P>This thinking sounds reasonable, but in reality it completely overlooks 
      the time factor, and the fact that the integral influence is very small 
      near setpoint (as will be discussed in the section on controllers at a 
      later date in this series of articles). To give an example, a controller 
      on a fast process (like flow), with a time constant of about 1 or 2 
      seconds, where the controller is tuned with fast integral, might take over 
      30 minutes to finally get a bad valve to the right position.&nbsp; On slow 
      processes like temperature with time constants of many minutes or even 
      longer, where the controller is tuned with slow integral, it may take the 
      controller literally many hours to get the valve positioned 
      correctly.&nbsp; One 'rule of thumb' right away is that on slow processes, 
      you cannot afford a poor valve if you want even half-reasonable control.
      <P>The majority of problems encountered in the control loop are to be 
      found in the final control element.&nbsp; The reason for this is that 
      whereas other components in the modern loop like the measuring transmitter 
      and controller are sophisticated devices, equipped with the latest 
      technology from the fields of physics, electronics, and computerisation, 
      and generally with absolutely minimum of moving parts, if any at all, the 
      valve in essence is a mechanical device where one 'chunk' of metal must be 
      positioned accurately and repeatably inside another 'chunk' of metal, 
      often under extremely difficult process conditions of temperature, 
      abrasion, stickiness, corrosion, pressure, etc.&nbsp; Any mechanical 
      device is subject to all sorts of problems such as wear, various types of 
      friction, repeatability, and rangeability. 
      <P>To give an idea of the problems encountered in typical industrial 
      plants, a large South African petro-chemical refinery optimised over 3,000 
      control loops in their plant.&nbsp; The engineer in charge of this project 
      reported that over 80% of the valves had to be worked on, or even 
      replaced, before reasonable control could be achieved.&nbsp; One of the 
      largest manufacturers of control valves in the world offer a service in 
      the USA and Europe whereby they go into plants (using any make of valve) 
      with computerised valve diagnostic equipment and give a report on the 
      state of the valves.&nbsp; The head of the UK branch told me that on 
      average, the first time they go into a plant, they find generally between 
      70 and 75% of the valves in the plant have noticeable problems requiring 
      correction if reasonable control is to be achieved.
      <P>There are many makes and types of control valves.&nbsp; A proper 
      control valve specifically designed for modulating control purposes is an 
      expensive device.&nbsp; Therefore people often go for cheaper 
      alternatives, using typically valves designed for manual operation, but 
      fitted with an actuator, and sometimes a positioner.&nbsp; This can be 
      sufficient for the control required, but the maxim remains:&nbsp; "If you 
      want good control you need a good valve".
      <P>The chief features of a good valve is that many years of research, 
      design know-how and experience has been put into it by the manufacturer to 
      make the valve perform properly.&nbsp; This performance will include 
      accurate, repeatable positioning, generally as quickly as possible, under 
      all the specified operating conditions.&nbsp; In addition most 
      manufacturers attempt to get the valve to respond to step changes as 
      exponentially as possible.&nbsp; A little known fact is that in PID 
      control, different tuning would in theory be needed for different sized 
      step changes if the response is not exponential, as will occur for example 
      on electrically actuated valves, which operate with a ramp response.&nbsp; 
      (In reality this is a minor problem, and would only possibly have a real 
      effect on very fast processes).
      <P>The use of a positioner on pneumatic actuated valves is 
      essential.&nbsp; I have often come across people who believe that one 
      should try and avoid positioners if possible.&nbsp; Typical thinking 
      includes the belief that positioners cause instability, that they 
      shouldn't ever be fitted to small valves and others.&nbsp; However a 
      positioner is a must, if you want good control.&nbsp; A good manufacturer 
      will ensure that the positioner on the valve does not cause instability if 
      set up properly.
      <P>A positioner does not however make up for an underpowered 
      actuator.&nbsp; The actuator is the device that actually provides the 
      motive power for the valve, not the positioner.&nbsp; The latter merely 
      ensures that the actuator does move the valve to the correct point as 
      given by the PD.&nbsp; On several occasions I have come across cases where 
      people have tried to save money by fitting smaller actuator, because a 
      positioner was fitted.&nbsp; This in fact creates an even more serious 
      problem which we have named "negative hysteresis", and this will be 
      described in an another article in the next couple of issues.
      <P>The correct sizing of the valve is very important as it affects the 
      process gain.&nbsp; This was discussed in a previous loop signature 
      dealing with the importance of process gain.&nbsp; The valve sizing is 
      itself of course established using a special formula.&nbsp; 
      <P>From the process gain point of view some general 'rules of thumb' are 
      that for practical purposes on self regulating processes the process gain 
      should be between 0.5 and 2.0.&nbsp; In the case of integrating processes, 
      the valve should be sized so that it is large enough to deal with the 
      biggest load into, (or out of as the case may be), the process. At the 
      same time the valve should not be too large so that under normal control 
      conditions it will not operate too close to its seat.
      <P>This is an interesting point.&nbsp; If a valve operates close to seat 
      under normal control conditions, apart from the fact that it is obviously 
      oversized, many valves become very non-linear in low operating 
      regions.&nbsp; A good guide is that the valve should under normal 
      conditions operate at over the 20% open position, but some valve experts 
      say that there should in fact be at least 20% of the actual flow through 
      the valve. In the latter case, in the case of a valve with an equal 
      percentage characteristic (see next article), it means that the valve 
      position should be open past the 45% position.
      <P>The inherent rangeability of a control valve is the ratio of maximum 
      controllable flow to minimum controllable flow.&nbsp; Typical figures for 
      various classes of valves are:
      <P>Globe valves:&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:1 to 30:1
      <P>V-notch ball:&nbsp;&nbsp; 100:1 to 300:1
      <P>Butterfly:&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:1 to 20:1
      <P>Sanders:&nbsp;&nbsp; 5:1
      <P>It is of interest to note that even the best control valve does not 
      have extremely wide rangeability, and if control is in fact required over 
      a wide range of flows, then other strategies requiring more than one valve 
      may be necessary.
      <P>Control problems can result when the required inherent rangeability 
      exceeds the actual inherent rangeability of the final control 
      element.&nbsp; Oversizing will of course reduce the inherent rangeability 
      of the valve directly by the process gain.
