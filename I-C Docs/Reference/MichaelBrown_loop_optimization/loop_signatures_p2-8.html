                <p><b>BASICS OF FREQUENCY PLOTS - PART 3</b></p>
                <p>In the <a href="http://www.controlloop.co.za/Loop_signatures/Loop_Signatures_P2-7/loop_signatures_p2-7.html">previous article</a>
in this series it was shown that the ideal Bode closed loop gain plot
for a simple first order lag, deadtime, self-regulating process is a
straight line sloping downwards from left to right at a slope of &#8211;20
db/decade. It is relatively easy to establish how good the tuning is
from this plot, and how safe it is. </p>
                <p>The first thing to check is
if good pole cancellation has been achieved. To do this one examines
the plot to see if the line is straight, for as mentioned in the
previous article, if it is bent up at the bottom, the response will be
slower than desirable, and the process may "step-up" to setpoint.&nbsp;
Alternatively if it is bent downwards at the bottom it will mean that
the response will be more cyclic than desirable. </p>
                <p>From the safety (sometimes
referred to as "robustness") point of view the plot allows us to easily
determine two factors called gain margin and phase margin.</p>
                <p>It will be remembered as well from the <a href="http://www.controlloop.co.za/Loop_signatures/Loop_Signatures_P2-7/loop_signatures_p2-7.html">previous article</a>
that for instability to occur in a feedback loop the combined loop gain
must be &#8805; unity (0db) and simultaneously, the (phase angle) must be at
-180°. </p>
                <p>The gain margin effectively
tells us how far away we are from unity gain on our combined plot; by
seeing what the value of the gain is when the phase lag is at -180°. In
the closed loop plot in Figure 1, it can be seen that when the phase
lag is at -180°, the actual gain is &#8211;8.06 db. Therefore to get to unity
gain we would have to increase our controller's proportional gain by a
further 8.06 db for instability to occur. We say that the gain margin
is 8.06 db. </p>
                <p><img id="Picture2" src="loop_signatures_p2-8_files/Loopsig2-8Fig1.jpg" alt="Loopsig2-8Fig1" title="Loopsig2-8Fig1" align="top" border="0" height="537" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="700"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 1</i></p>
                <p>For
interest's sake, quarter-wave damping has a gain margin of
approximately 6.25 db.&nbsp; As mentioned in previous articles, quarter
wave damping is not recommended for several practical reasons, and the
fastest tuning on a self-regulating process as recommended by
Techmation, the manufacturers of the Protuner Loop Analyser, would have
a gain margin of 8 db.&nbsp; This would result in one overshoot and one
undershoot on this simple process.</p>
                <p>The phase
margin tells us how far we are away from -180°, when the gain in the
loop is unity.&nbsp; As can be seen in Figure 1, if we go to the unity
gain mark we can read off the phase lag at this point, which is roughly
120°. Therefore our phase margin is 180° - 120° = 60°. As a general
rule of thumb 60° is about the minimum phase margin one would like to
see on this type of process.</p>
                <p>Another
factor that can be taken into account when looking at robustness of
tuning is something called the damping factor.&nbsp; This is however
considerably more complicated and is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
                <p>This
concludes this section on the basics of frequency plots.&nbsp; The main
reason why I have included it is so that the reader will have a better
understanding of the remaining articles in this series.&nbsp; These
will be dealing with the approach to the tuning of every single process
dynamic he or she may encounter in the real world of industrial
control.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>Very
few people actually ever use frequency plots, which in reality are
almost impossible to generate from a real process unless you have a
tool like the Protuner that is capable of doing this.&nbsp; I myself
use them for the odd occasion where a limited controller does not let
me use the tuning parameters I would like to have inserted in the
controller.&nbsp; Typically many controllers have very limited low-end
gains. For example, a well known make of PLC prevents one for putting
in gains less than 0.5, and on fast processes like flows, it is one
generally uses gains much smaller than that.&nbsp; Therefore in cases
like that, one can start fiddling around in the PLC to try and change
the loop gain by inserting some other block in the loop, or
alternatively one can try and get by by using the bigger gain that you
are limited to, and then increasing the integral until sufficient gain
and phase margins are reached. (This may not give nice control but it
will be probably be better than the original "as-found" tuning).</p>
                <p>The
other thing that I use the frequency plot for is to model a process for
simulation.&nbsp; This is a powerful feature in the Protuner, which
after doing the tuning from the frequency plots, then builds a transfer
function model using the Bode Plots.&nbsp; Unfortunately this can be
rather limited especially on more complex dynamics. In cases like these
one has to "tweak" the model.</p>
                <p>In
the next loop signature article we will start off our examination of
every single type of process dynamics that one would be likely to find
in industrial processes. These are all more complicated than the simple
one we have been dealing with in the last few articles.&nbsp; Many of
them are considered very difficult to control using feedback control.</p>
