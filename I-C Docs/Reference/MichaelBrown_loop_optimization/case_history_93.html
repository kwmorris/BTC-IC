                <p><b>SPECIFYING A DIGITAL FEEDBACK CONTROLLER - part 1</b></p>
                <p>Musa
Mtshali, a C&amp;I technician with a pulp company in Swaziland,
recently asked me to write a Case History article listing all the
important points that should be included in the specifications when a
company requests tenders for a DCS or PLC control system. Here it is,
Musa.</p>
                <p>As
mentioned many times in past articles, I have been in hundreds of
plants situated across many countries around the world, and still I
have never met anyone in these plants who really understands the
operation, the various features, and the options generally available in
their digital control system (normally a DCS or PLC system). As a
result many of these plants are not working as well as they could, as
the control systems are not configured optimally. This poor control
can, and has resulted in sometimes huge loss in potential extra profits.</p>
                <p>To site just a few examples from plants I have worked in: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A
pharmaceutical plant in the UK is under-producing by some £14,000,000
p.a. as the D term is not being used correctly because of an incorrect
choice of controller options. They cannot now change this as their
manufacturing process is "sealed" by drug authorities in the various
countries where they sell their products, and it is now practically
impossible to get the specifications changed. </li>
                    <li>A big mining plant
had been running for over 8 years, with a "homemade" PID algorithm
written by the PLC programmer.&nbsp; Unfortunately it didn't work and
the controllers tuning parameters could not be changed.</li>
                    <li>Many
plants all around the world using certain top range DCS control systems
have never ever been able to properly tune loops because the default
configuration of the controllers in these systems is such that there is
only integral response on setpoint change.&nbsp; (Even more amazing is
the fact that the "experts" in these plants were not aware of this, and
even more amazing is that they have never been told about it by the
equipment manufacturers, or their representatives). In South Africa
these plants include leading petrochemical, chemical, and paper
companies.</li>
                    <li>Over
80% of all PLC control systems I come across being used for feedback
control have their control blocks incorrectly configured, so the
control cannot work properly.</li>
                    <li>A&nbsp; PLC
on a ferrochrome furnace had been incorrectly programmed so that it
caused a pressure control valve to first shut, when it was switched
from manual to automatic.&nbsp; This resulted in oxygen being sucked
into the furnace and caused an explosion.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Many
people do not believe me when they read things like this, but I come
across similar situations all the time.&nbsp; The main problem is that
as I have repeatedly said, very few people really understand the
practicalities of feedback control systems, as they have never been on
courses that teach these things.&nbsp; Practical control teaching is
very different from the studies most people do when they learn control
at an academic institution.</p>
                <p>Anyway these are the things I believe a prospective purchaser of a control system should specify or certainly investigate:</p>
                <p><b>Basic Controller Algorithm</b></p>
                <p>The
Series algorithm is in my opinion the preferred, as I have found that
the D term operates more efficiently than the others, and offers better
cancellation on certain process dynamics. </p>
                <p>Series:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <img id="Picture3" src="case_history_93_files/cashis_93_eq1.gif" alt="cashis 93 eq1" title="cashis 93 eq1" align="top" border="0" height="90" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="300"></p>
                <p>Where K<sub>P</sub> is controller gain, T<sub>i</sub> is integral time in seconds/repeat, T<sub>D</sub> is derivative time in seconds, and S is the Laplace operator.</p>
                <p>The
Ideal algorithm unfortunately appears to becoming the most popular on
most systems.&nbsp; However, although not as good as the Series, it is
not too bad, and if the Series is not available, then it can be used.</p>
                <p>Ideal (ISA): &nbsp;  <img id="Picture4" src="case_history_93_files/cashis_93_eq_2.gif" alt="cashis 93 eq 2" title="cashis 93 eq 2" align="top" border="0" height="95" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="250"></p>
                <p>The
Parallel algorithm which is the default algorithm offered by some very
well known makes of PLC's, and also by at least one well know make of
DCS should never be used.&nbsp; The problem with it is that integral
and derivative terms are effectively altered every time the P gain is
changed, which makes tuning a nightmare.&nbsp; (See <a href="http://www.controlloop.co.za/Loop_signatures/Loop_Signatures_12/loop_signatures_12.html">article P1-12</a> in my first Loop Signature series for an explanation).
                </p>
                <p>Parallel:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img id="Picture6" src="case_history_93_files/cashis_93eq3.gif" alt="cashis 93eq3" title="cashis 93eq3" align="top" border="0" height="87" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="210">
                </p>
                <p><b>Implementation of the PID Algorithm</b></p>
                <p>The
preferred form of digitisation of the PID algorithm is definitely the
positional implementation. It is generally more accurate, but does use
more processing power than the other, the incremental (or velocity)
implementation.&nbsp; If the incremental implementation is used, then
you should ensure that you can switch off the I term on occasions when
only P or PD control is required. Also ensure that integral windup can
be prevented with the incremental implementation. This is also very
important when using the controller as the primary controller in a
cascade control system, or as a controller in a selective control
system, where integral must be frozen from an external signal under
certain conditions.</p>
                <p><b>Tuning Parameters</b></p>
                <p>Some
manufacturers limit the PID tuning settings which may limit the
settings needed for certain conditions. The following are suggested
ranges for the tuning parameters:</p>
