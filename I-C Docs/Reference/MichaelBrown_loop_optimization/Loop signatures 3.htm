      "signatures" : process dynamics - process gain</FONT></B><FONT

      <P>An instrumentation technician once told me that to him a process 
      consists only of a trace on a screen.&nbsp; This is rather a sad 
      attitude.&nbsp; If one wishes to control a process then it is important to 
      have a reasonable basic knowledge and understanding of the process itself, 
      and certainly one should also be aware of what external influences can act 
      on it.&nbsp; To this end, if you are not intimately familiar with the 
      process yourself, it is essential that you work with a process expert who 
      can guide and help you in gaining this understanding.&nbsp; Apart from 
      this, if you wish to successfully optimise the control of a process, it is 
      also essential that you establish the dynamics of the process.
      <P>Process dynamics are described by an equation known as the process 
      transfer function, which can be loosely described as various factors which 
      cause the output of the process to respond in a particular way to any 
      change on the input of the process.&nbsp; The importance of understanding 
      the dynamics of any process is fundamental to successful control 
      optimisation, and cannot be overstressed.&nbsp; In our control 
      optimisation courses, process dynamics occupies a large part of the more 
      advanced part of the course.&nbsp; Unfortunately all this information is 
      beyond the scope of these articles, and only a few of the more basic 
      factors will be covered, viz. process gain, deadtime, and single first 
      order lags.&nbsp; It is of interest to note that these three factors were, 
      and largely still are, the only factors that are taken into account in 
      many of the more simplistic tuning techniques, (for example, Ziegler &amp; 
      Nicholls tuning), which is one of the reasons why these tuning methods 
      often fail, as there are also many other dynamic factors that may occur in 
      real process responses.
      <P>In this article we will deal with process gain, firstly for self 
      regulating processes, and secondly for integrating processes.
      <P>Figure 1 shows a simple pressure control self regulating loop. </FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica color=#000000 size=-1>The 
      controller is in manual, and a step change is made on the output of the 
      controller (process demand - PD).&nbsp; The pressure (process variable - 
      PV), rises up exponentially and settles out at a new value.&nbsp; The 
      process gain is defined as the size of the step in PV, measured after it 
      has reached steady state, divided by the size of the step that was made in 
      the PD.&nbsp; The measurements are made in percent of span, and as these 
      units cancel, process gain of a self regulating process is unitless.&nbsp; 
      It is also sometimes referred to as loop forward gain, or steady state 
      gain.&nbsp; It can be thought of as an amplification factor in the 
process.
      <P>In practice the process gain is very important.&nbsp; It is made up by 
      two factors, the first being the valve sizing, and the second the spanning 
      of the transmitter.&nbsp; Ideally one would like to use the full span of 
      both devices, particularly that of the valve, which being a mechanical 
      devices is very limited in rangeability, and may suffer from problems like 
      hysteresis and backlash.&nbsp; Therefore if the valve was moved from 0 - 
      100% open operating position, and the measurement responded likewise from 
      0 - 100%, then the process gain would be unity, which is ideal.
      <P>As a general rule of thumb, if the process gain is greater than unity 
      the valve is oversized, and if it is less than unity, it is usually due to 
      the transmitter span being too wide.
      <P>One disadvantages of a valve being oversized is that the proportional 
      gain in the controller has to be correspondingly reduced to achieve a 
      desired response.&nbsp; This leads to problems on many controllers that 
      have limited low end gains.&nbsp; Typically many commercial controllers 
      are limited to a minimum gain of 0.1 (or 1000% proportional band).&nbsp; 
      On fast processes like flows, which are tuned with low gain and fast 
      integral, it may not be possible to set a low enough gain in the 
      controller if the valve is oversized.
      <P>Another and probably even more important disadvantage of oversized 
      valves is that the process gain actually amplifies the valve 
      imperfections, and results in a degradation of control performance.&nbsp; 
      Therefore if a valve suffers from say a 1% hysteresis (which is pretty 
      normal), the offset as seen on the PV will be that 1% offset multiplied by 
      the process gain.&nbsp; For example if we had a process gain of 4, then 
      the offset on the PV would be 4%.&nbsp; This means that the control error 
      also becomes bigger in a directly proportional relationship to the valve 
      oversizing.&nbsp; Also if a cycle occurs in closed loop due to a valve 
      problem, like a hysteresis cycle on an integrating loop, then the 
      amplitude of the cycle as seen on the PV, will also be multiplied&nbsp; by 
      the process gain.<P>On the other side, if a transmitter is spanned too 
      wide which results in a process a gain of less than unity, problems can 
      occur firstly with the quality of the measurement.&nbsp; For example if 
      the process gain was 0.5, it would mean that only the first 50% of the 
      transmitter span was being used.&nbsp; If this was on say an orifice flow, 
      it would severely limit the useful flow range and measurement accuracy.
      <P>Secondly a low process gain also necessitates having to increase the 
      controller proportional gain to achieve a particular control 
      response.&nbsp; This makes the output of the controller more "jumpy", and 
      will also further amplify signal noise which results in increased valve 
      wear and possibly increased control variance.
      <P>As a general rule of thumb, good engineering practice dictates that the 
      process gain for a self regulating process should lie between 0.5 and 2.0.
      <P>Figure 2 shows an open loop test performed in a South African 
      petrochemical refinery, on a flow control valve that was hugely oversized.

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica color=#000000 size=-1>The 
      process gain in this case was close to 13!&nbsp; The valve itself had 
      negligible hysteresis and as a result, in this particular case, good 
      control could in fact be achieved.&nbsp; However to realise this, the 
      proportional gain that had to be inserted in the controller was 0.000125 
      (or proportional band of 8,000%)!
      <P>Process gain for an integrating loop is rather different.&nbsp; As 
      explained in the last article in this series, the PV can only be constant 
      in an integrating process when the PD is at the balance point.&nbsp; Once 
      the PD moves off balance the, PV starts ramping.
      <P>One way of defining the process gain for an integrating level loop 
      would be the as the slope of the PV ramp resulting when the PD is at 100%, 
      and there is zero flow out of (or into, as the case may be), the other 
      side of the tank.&nbsp; Figure 3 shows how the process gain is measured in 
      practice for such a process.&nbsp; The unit of process gain for an 
      integrating process is "inverse seconds".&nbsp; (It is a slope).</FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica color=#000000 size=-1>The 
      reciprocal of the process gain for a level process, is known as the tank 
      retention time.&nbsp; This is the time that it would take for the tank to 
      empty from full to zero if there was no flow into the other side of the 
      tank.&nbsp; As most tanks would take a considerable time to empty, it 
      becomes apparent that the process gain of most integrating processes, will 
      be tiny numbers, generally much, much, smaller than unity.&nbsp; For 
      example if the retention time of a tank was 1,000 seconds, its process 
      gain would be 0.001.
      <P>Therefore in light of this, another fact becomes immediately 
      apparent,&nbsp; and this that if fast control is required for an 
      integrating processes, in most cases, one is going to need relatively high 
      proportional gains in the controller to counter the small process 
      gains.</FONT>
