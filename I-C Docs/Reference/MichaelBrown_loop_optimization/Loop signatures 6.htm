      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>Feedback theory 
      generally assumes that the process has a "linear transfer function".&nbsp; 
      Essentially this means that the transfer equation describing the process 
      is linear which means that equal changes on the input will result in equal 
      changes on the output.&nbsp; (The magnitudes of the changes of the input 
      and output steps themselves may be different as this is dependent on the 
      process gain). 
      <P>Figure 1 illustrates a simple open loop test on a simple self 
      regulating process to ascertain if the process has got what is known as 
      "an linear installed characteristic".&nbsp; </FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>Several equal steps 
      are made on the PD and the responses on the PV studied.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the 
      magnitude of the output steps are equal then the process has a linear 
      installed characteristic.&nbsp; If the magnitude of the steps change as 
      the measurement moves over the range, then the installed characteristic is 
      non-linear.&nbsp; Both types of responses are illustrated in the Figure 1.
      <P>Why is linearity important?&nbsp; The answer lies in the fact that as 
      mentioned in the earlier article on process gain, the tuning of the 
      controller's P term is largely dependent on the process gain.&nbsp; If the 
      process has not got installed linearity, then this would mean that the 
      tuning would only be good at the one place on the measuring range where 
      the particular process gain was used in the tuning calculation.&nbsp; At 
      other places where the process gain was smaller, the control response 
      would be more sluggish, and where it was bigger, the response would be 
      faster and&nbsp; more cyclic, and could in fact even become 
      unstable.&nbsp; 
      <P>Non-linearity can occur in any of the different elements making up the 
      control loop.&nbsp; There can be non-linearity in the measuring system, in 
      the process itself, in the controller (although as the controller is in 
      manual here, this will not affect the test under discussion), and in the 
      final control element itself.&nbsp; Let us assume for the present case 
      that the measuring system, process, and controller are all linear.&nbsp; 
      If this is so, then the final control element must also display what is 
      known as an "installed" linear characteristic of its position versus the 
      flow though it, if we want the whole process to be linear.. 
      <P>Figure 2 illustrates two specific types of very common inherent valve 
      characteristics, linear and equal percentage. </FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>There are also other 
      relatively common characteristic curves available.&nbsp; People are very 
      often confused as to why one doesn't always just use an inherent linear 
      characteristic; after all the graph shows a straight line relationship 
      between flow through the valve, and valve stem position.
      <P>To answer why this is not necessarily true, one must understand how the 
      inherent characteristics are generated.&nbsp; The test performed by the 
      manufacturer to generate the curve is accomplished by placing the valve in 
      a flow rig which is so arranged that the valve has got a completely 
      constant differential pressure across it at all times.
      <P>However in real life situations the valve may, and often is, installed 
      in a pipework configuration where the differential pressure across the 
      valve can vary as the flow through the valve changes. Bearing in mind that 
      a valve can be thought of as a "variable orifice", and from Bernoulli's 
      theorem we know that the flow through an orifice is (amongst other 
      factors) proportional to the square root of the differential pressure 
      across the orifice.&nbsp; Therefore where the differential pressure across 
      the valve is free to change, the installed valve characteristic is far 
      from linear.&nbsp; To counteract this, the valve manufacturers offer a 
      characteristic called "equal percentage", where the percentage increase in 
      stem position equals the percentage increase in flow.&nbsp; This can be 
      roughly thought of as a mechanical square root extractor which will result 
      in a linear installed characteristic. 
      <P>There are as mentioned, many other characteristic curves available as 
      standard; quick opening is another example.&nbsp; The next question is: 
      How do people know what characteristics to employ when installing 
      valves?&nbsp; The answer to this is that normally there is no easy 
      way.&nbsp; Valve characteristics are generally chosen from either past 
      experience or by guess work.&nbsp; If a person has worked on similar 
      processes before, they will have a very good idea of the correct 
      characteristic.&nbsp; There are also many articles published on how to 
      choose the right characteristic.&nbsp; Most of these fall in the category 
      called "SWAG", a wonderful acronym coined by an American control 
      journalist some years ago.&nbsp; It stands for "Scientific Wild Ass 
Guess".
      <P>To illustrate this point, take the table given in Figure 3. </FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>It is a summary of 
      recommendations of choosing the right characteristic taken from a valve 
      manufacturer's handbook.&nbsp; The only recommendation in it that really 
      makes sense to me is the last one where you will generally use a linear 
      inherent characteristic on level applications, because in most such cases 
      you have constant differential pressure across the valve.
      <P>It is necessary then to check that your valves do in fact have 
      installed linearity.&nbsp; In about 35% of cases we find installed 
      non-linearity, but this is often very much dependent on particular plants. 

      <P>If we do find installed non-linearity on a control loop, is it really 
      important to linearise it?&nbsp; The answer depends on other factors, such 
      as: How important is the control?&nbsp; Can you afford instability or 
      sluggishness, and finally what is the control actually doing in reality?
      <P>This last question is relatively important.&nbsp; Many loops are only 
      there to deal with minor load changes, the setpoint is never varied, and 
      the measurement doesn't move around too much.&nbsp; In such a case then 
      the non-linearity will not affect things much.&nbsp; However in a case 
      where the loop works hard, and the measurement may move around all over 
      the place.&nbsp; For example a secondary cascade loop generally moves 
      around over a very wide range.&nbsp; In such cases it is probably will be 
      very advantageous to linearise the characteristics in order to get optimum 
      control all over the range.
      <P>Common methods of linearising installed characteristics are:
      <P>1. Change the valve trim.
      <P>2. Install a positioner cam which has the mirror image of the installed 
      characteristic.
      <P>3. Use an "X-Y" table or a curve shaping facility in either the 
      controller's output, or preferably in the positioner if such a facility is 
      available.&nbsp; (Note that if the linearization is done in the 
      controller's output, you must be careful when performing tests, as the 
      actual controller's output is the true PD, and the PD signal coming out on 
      the terminals of the control system where you may be measuring, is now 
      characterised.).
