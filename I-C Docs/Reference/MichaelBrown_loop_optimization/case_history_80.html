                <p style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;">POOR CONTROL PERFORMANCE IS A WORLD WIDE PHENOMENON</span></b></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As
mentioned many times in previous articles, the state of regulatory
controls in plants is in fact unbelievably bad.&nbsp;Based on my
experience in every one of the several hundred plants where I have
performed optimisation, less than 5% of all loops in automatic operate
at all effectively.&nbsp;I am frequently asked during my courses in
Southern Africa if the state of controls in first world countries is
any better.&nbsp;I will answer this later.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
problems with controls is firstly largely due to a global complete lack
of training on the practical aspects of control loop operation and
optimisation, and secondly on the ignorance and lack of awareness on
the true state of things by senior management including control
managers.&nbsp;They seem to think everything is working well, having
accepted the control performance over the years, and have no idea
whatsoever of what huge improvements, and additional profits could be
achieved if control optimisation was properly instituted as a separate
distinct discipline.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Most
senior control people think of optimisation as "loop tuning", and
believe it can be performed by lower level disciplines in the control
departments.&nbsp;They generally treat it as of very minor importance,
and are not prepared to invest any capital in it and allow very little
engineering time to achieve results.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Prior
to plant courses I always advise the plant that at least one senior
manager or engineer from the instrumentation and control department
should attend, as well as a senior process manager, as optimisation can
only succeed if both departments work as a team, and it can also only
succeed with good management support from both of the departments.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">On
very many instances I find on my arrival at the plant, that the
delegates are all relatively low level mechanicians, without even a
technician amongst them, let alone an engineer, a manager, or a process
person.&nbsp;The delegates, although usually as keen as mustard, often
have no experience of control loops, have very little experience of
working on PLC's and/or DCS's, and many have great difficulty in
following the course concepts.&nbsp;They often complain that they will
get very little management support in practicing optimisation after the
course, and feel the training will be wasted.&nbsp;They generally say
they have been sent on a "tuning course".&nbsp;I always correct them
and advise that they are on an <i>optimisation course, in which tuning is a relatively tiny part.</i></span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One
control manager recently told me that his senior people already were
well versed in optimisation, that they were far too busy to attend such
a basic course, and that optimisation had nothing to do with the
process people.&nbsp;He also mentioned that at least 95% of the loops
in the plant were already operating reasonably well.&nbsp;However every
one of the approximately 30 simple loops we looked at during the
practical part of the course was in fact not operating at all
well.&nbsp;The majority had major problems that no one was aware of,
and not a single one had tuning even close to what could be regarded as
optimum.&nbsp;During this session we got every one of those loops
working many times better than it was before.&nbsp;One very critical
temperature control loop in particular was optimised to respond some
600 times faster than it previously did.&nbsp;One can only speculate
what additional profits that could have been made over the years, and
which are still being lost with the controls operating so poorly.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In
most cases where management have gone along with my suggestions and
included senior control and also process people on the courses, the
results have been astounding, and optimisation in those plants is now
an established discipline.&nbsp;One very senior control manager with
many years field experience in a large petro-chemical refinery, who at
first had strongly disagreed with me on the need for senior people to
perform optimisation, finally decided to attend the course
himself.&nbsp;At the end of the course he went around the plant on his
own doing his own little control loop audit.&nbsp;He then emailed me to
admit he had been wrong, that from now on all optimisation would be
performed by senior experienced personnel, and that all advanced
control work would be halted until the "base layer" was properly
optimised.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Are
things different in first world countries?&nbsp;My experience is that
the plants there are just as bad as those in Southern
Africa.&nbsp;Possibly they have access to better trained personnel, but
once again they have no knowledge of the practical side of control loop
optimisation.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I
have included a few examples of problems that nobody was aware of taken
from a large chemical plant in Europe where I performed some
optimisation work am few months ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">An
open loop test performed on a very critical flow loop is shown in
Figure 1.&nbsp;It was essential that this loop work as fast as
possible.&nbsp;The process people complained that the variance on this
control was high and the plant was loosing a lot of money because of it.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img id="Picture46" src="case_history_80_files/cashis80Fig_1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" title="Figure 1" vspace="0" width="550" height="412" hspace="0" align="TOP" border="0"></span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Figure 1</i></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
test shows that the valve response was very bad.&nbsp;The valve took
over 30 seconds to respond to 5% steps in the closing direction, but
only 4 seconds in the opening direction, which is more
normal.&nbsp;There is obviously something very wrong with this
valve.&nbsp;There is no way that one can get good fast control until
this valve is sorted out.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure
2 shows an open loop test on another flow loop.&nbsp;The valve here
displays an interesting problem.&nbsp;It shows an inverse response each
time the valve moves.&nbsp;Once it does start moving in the right
direction, it travels extremely slowly and takes about a minute to get
to the new position. That is incredibly slow for a pneumatically
operated valve.&nbsp;Once again good control is impossible with such a
final control element.&nbsp;However if the valve had moved faster it is
possible, and highly probable, that automatic control with it would
have been impossible, as the inverse response may have resulted in a
continuous cycle on a fast process like flow.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img id="Picture47" src="case_history_80_files/cashis80Fig_2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" title="Figure 2" vspace="0" width="550" height="409" hspace="0" align="TOP" border="0"></span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 2</span></i></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is interesting to note that both of these valves were equipped with smart positioners.&nbsp;(See previous Case 
                    History article on valves equipped with smart positioners).</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
next example is of a temperature control loop which was cycling
continually.&nbsp; The process people were despairing of this loop,
which was very important. The product quality&nbsp;was also being badly
affected by the poor control performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The open loops test shown in Figure 3 is a very interesting one.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><img id="Picture48" src="case_history_80_files/cashis80Fig_3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" title="Figure 3" vspace="0" width="550" height="409" hspace="0" align="TOP" border="0"></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 3</span></i></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
process dynamics fall into the integrating (or ramping) class of
processes.&nbsp;Some of the more unusual features in the dynamics of
this process are:</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
process gain is 0.035 (equivalent to a retention time of 28 seconds)
which is extremely fast for an integrating process, particularly so for
a temperature.&nbsp;It can be seen in the test how a really tiny change
of only 1.7% on the controller output resulted in a really fast ramp.</span></li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
temperature sensing element is mounted some considerable distance from
the heating source, resulting in a deadtime of almost 1 minute.&nbsp;</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
combination of these two factors make the process extremely difficult
to control.&nbsp;It is one where it is almost impossible to try and
control in manual.&nbsp;Ideally the temperature sensor should be moved
much closer to the heating source to try and reduce the deadtime as
much as possible.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Feedback
control can just work to control this process provided that all the
equipment is perfect.&nbsp;It will be remembered&nbsp;from the articles
on valve hysteresis in the Loop Signature series of articles, that any
valve hysteresis on an integrating process will result in a continuous
cycle with PI control in automatic.&nbsp;Normally the relatively small
hysteresis (&lt; 1%) found on most valves does not cause a
significantly noticeable cycle.&nbsp;However in this case with the long
deadtime and large process gain, even the slightest hysteresis will
cause really bad cycling.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure
4 illustrates how the loop with relatively good tuning went into
a&nbsp;4% amplitude cycle with only a small 0 .5% hysteresis on the
valve.&nbsp;This would be an ideal case to use a secondary flow control
cascaded to the temperature to eliminate the hysteresis as seen by the
temperature controller.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><img id="Picture49" src="case_history_80_files/cashis80Fig_4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" title="Figure 4" vspace="0" width="550" height="411" hspace="0" align="TOP" border="0"></span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Figure 4</span></i></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">These
are only a few of the many problems that were encountered in the course
in this plant, and were typical of things I have seen in Southern
African plants, and also in all plants I have worked on in other
countries as well.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One
thing that was slightly different was that the particular country where
this plant is situated is very socialistic and has very strong labour
unions.&nbsp;In this case the people who were responsible for fixing
the valves, and the people who dealt with the DCS were in different
departments falling under separate unions.&nbsp;Nobody from the valve
department had been included on the course, and when we encountered the
problems that were occurring on the valves, there was no way in which
the DCS people could get the valve people to do anything about the
problems.&nbsp;The latter merely came back and said they had checked
the valves and were quite happy that they were set-up properly, and did
not have any problems.</span></p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I
find it hard enough having to try and sort out control
problems.&nbsp;When it comes to union and interdepartmental problems, I
can only throw up my hands.&nbsp;Again I come back to the vital point
that optimisation is a multi-disciplinary function, and can only be
performed with teams working together from all relevant departments,
including the process people.</span></p>
