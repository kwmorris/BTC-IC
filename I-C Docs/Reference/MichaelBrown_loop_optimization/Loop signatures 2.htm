      "signatures" - the two classes of processes</FONT></B>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>This article will 
      discuss the two classes of processes called self-regulating and 
      integrating (or ramping) processes.
      <P>This subject is absolutely vital to regulatory control but strangely is 
      seldom taught on control courses, and in fact there are very few 
      instrumentation and control personnel who have even heard of this subject.
      <P>From the control point of view, every process falls into the one or the 
      other of the two classes.&nbsp; They behave, and are tuned very 
      differently.&nbsp; It is essential that one must fully understand the 
      difference if successful optimisation is to be achieved.
      <P>Figure 1 illustrates the basic difference in responses between the two 
      classes of processes. </FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>Self-regulating 
      processes are characterised by an open loop response to a step change that 
      rises or falls to some new and constant value after the loop dynamics have 
      died out.&nbsp; Integrating processes are characterized by an open loop 
      response to a step input change that ramps continuously at a constant rate 
      after the loop dynamics have died out.
      <P>A typical example of a self-regulating process is the flow process 
      shown in Figure 2.&nbsp; The process variable (PV) effectively follows the 
      movements of the process demand (PD).</FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>Integrating processes 
      however, which are typified by level control processes as shown in Figure 
      3, have a very different relationship between PD and PV.</FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>All integrating 
      processes rely on balancing the input and output of the process to keep 
      the PV constant.&nbsp; In the case of the level control, the PV remains 
      constant when the PD has the valve at such a position so that the flows in 
      and out of the tank are equal.&nbsp; When this condition exists, the 
      process is said to be balanced, and the PD and actual valve stem position 
      are said to be at the balance point. 
      <P>If the PD is stepped away from the balance point, the inflow and 
      outflow will now differ, and the level will either move up or down, as the 
      case may be, in the form of a constant ramp.&nbsp; If the PD is left at 
      the same place, the ramp will continue until the tank empties, or 
      overflows.&nbsp; 
      <P>This means that an integrating process is inherently unstable, because 
      if left in manual, the balance point will change sooner or later due to 
      load changes, and the process will tend to "run away".&nbsp; Therefore 
      integrating processes cannot be left unattended in manual for too long, 
      and in fact must really be controlled in automatic.&nbsp; Self regulating 
      processes on the other hand are inherently stable and can be left in 
      manual. 
      <P>In view of this one could query why self regulating processes need to 
      be controlled at all.&nbsp; The main reason that controllers are used for 
      the vast majority of self regulating processes is to cope with load 
      changes.&nbsp; (Load changes can be defined as a change in conditions 
      external to the loop causing the PV to change, and to move away from 
      set-point). Of course in some cases the controller is there to make the 
      process follow setpoint changes.
      <P>It can, in certain instances, be very difficult to decide in which 
      class a process should belong, as some processes appear to be both 
      integrating and self regulating&nbsp; For example take the case of a level 
      process similar to that illustrated in Figure 3, but without the pump at 
      the bottom of the tank.&nbsp; Such a process is referred to as a "gravity 
      fed" tank.&nbsp; If the level in this tank was in balance and the control 
      valve was then opened a bit, the level would then start ramping down in 
      the typical integrating fashion.&nbsp; However as it drops the hydrostatic 
      head above the outlet pipe would&nbsp; decrease, thus causing the flow to 
      decrease as well.&nbsp; The ramp rate would also decrease, and eventually 
      if the valve had not been stepped too far, the level would balance itself 
      out again, before the tank emptied.&nbsp; The response on the PV would 
      actually look in the long term like a self regulating processes.&nbsp; So 
      what class of process does it actually belong to?
      <P>The rule of thumb is:&nbsp; "You tune a process the way it starts 
      reacting".&nbsp; So if a process starts out as integrating (like the 
      gravity fed tank), and then turns into a self regulating process, you tune 
      it as an integrating process.&nbsp; If it starts out as a self regulating 
      process, and then becomes integrating, then it is tuned as a self 
      regulating process.
      <P>Other rules of thumb are that flows are always self regulating, and 
      levels integrating.&nbsp; One exception on levels, is controlling the head 
      over a weir, which is self regulating.&nbsp; It can be sometimes quite 
      difficult to decide into which class of processes pressures and 
      temperature processes fall.&nbsp; One way to decide is to look at the 
      response of the processes to changes when the loop is in manual or in 
      automatic.&nbsp; Typical responses are shown in Figure 4.</FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>The importance of 
      understanding the subject cannot be over-stressed if you wish to 
      successfully optimise controls of processes.&nbsp; Most people have a 
      basic feel of how self regulating processes operate, and how to go about 
      tuning them.&nbsp; However in general very few people have any 
      understanding, and even more importantly, any feel on how to tune 
      integrating loops.
      <P>In most plants I go into the integrating loops are in a shocking way, 
      mostly being so badly tuned that they exhibit very slow cyclic responses 
      to setpoint or load changes.&nbsp; Many are in a continuous&nbsp; very 
      slow cycle.&nbsp; I was quite amused recently, when after an in-plant 
      course in one of South Africa's largest petro-chemical refineries, the 
      chief control engineer, a man with high qualifications, and many years of 
      experience behind him, admitted to me after the course, that the section 
      on optimising integrating loops had been a real eye opener to his staff 
      and to him, and that he now agreed that probably not a single one of the 
      many hundreds of level loops in his plant had been tuned correctly.
      <P>Figure 5 illustrates a typical example of an "as found" level control 
      response to a step change in setpoint, and Figure 6, the response on the 
      same loop&nbsp; after proper tuning for "tight" control. </FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>It should be noted 
      that not all levels are tuned this way, as in some processes the level 
      control is detuned to prevent the control valve from moving around too 
      much, but this is the subject for another discussion.
