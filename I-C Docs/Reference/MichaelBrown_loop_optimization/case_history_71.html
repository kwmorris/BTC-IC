                <p>Just
before starting on this piece, I read a fascinating article by a valve
manufacturer in the April issue of SA Instrumentation &amp; Control
magazine, which mentioned a case where a relatively small 1.4%
improvement in control variance which was achieved by replacing a poor
valve, led to an annual cost saving of over R8,000,000!&nbsp;This was
on only one loop!&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In
a study recently completed in the USA, and based on 300 control loop
installations, it was stipulated that in the average plant, if 30% of
the loops are operating inefficiently in automatic, the annual
opportunity cost&nbsp;would exceed US$350,000.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>As
mentioned repeatedly in my articles, the experiences of myself and
others have found that in the average plant world wide, in fact over
85% of the loops are operating completely inefficiently in
automatic.&nbsp;It literally boggles the mind as to what absolutely
incredible annual economic benefits (certainly in the region of many
millions of Rands), could be achieved if people would firstly only
admit that there are problems in their plants, and then institute
optimisation as a separate discipline!</p>
                <p>Time
and time I preach this message, but relatively few plants will do
anything about it.&nbsp;In many cases their control chiefs refuse to
admit that there are failings, and that they can learn some new and
fascinating things about how practical control optimisation techniques
can be applied.&nbsp;In other cases, the lower rungs of management find
it difficult to present enough economic justification to top management
and the Board, to get the necessary funds needed to implement this
discipline.</p>
                <p>A
very interesting example of the refusal to admit to problems arose
recently in a processing plant with which I have been acquainted for
many years, as I provided and built the original control systems and
panels for the plant when it was built in the 1970's.&nbsp;The original
controllers were of the old stand-alone electronic type.&nbsp;They were
later replaced with a PLC-SCADA system.</p>
                <p>When
I specialised in regulatory control optimisation in the 90's, this was
one of the first plants I visited, as I knew that for various reasons,
there were probably tremendous problems with their controls.&nbsp;After
a presentation lasting several hours I was told by their Chief Control
Engineer and Leading Technician, that none of the problems I had
discussed existed in their plant, and it would be almost impossible to
improve on its already impressive performance.&nbsp;As the years went
by I had quite a few of their process engineers and specialists on my
courses, but never any of their instrumentation and control people.</p>
                <p>About
2 years ago I was optimising the controls on another plant in the same
group, and I worked with a senior instrument technician who had
recently been transferred across from the plant under
discussion.&nbsp;He told me that although I was finding all the usual
problems in the plant we were now working in, the controls in his old
plant were absolutely perfect.&nbsp;He spent quite a long time telling
me how well everything was working, and that it could be classed as a
problem free plant as far as the controls were concerned.</p>
                <p>Strangely
enough the process specialists who were on my courses were not so
convinced that this was the case.&nbsp;A few years ago I offered to
perform an audit for a day to examine a few of their faster control
loops (which they were convinced were operating so well).&nbsp;The
Chief Control Engineer didn't even bother to reply to my offer.</p>
                <p>However
a few months ago the Process Manager decided that he would like to see
the results of such an audit, and placed an order for it.</p>
                <p>The
results of this work is really interesting.&nbsp;Seven loops were
examined.&nbsp;On the whole they were simple fast loops that should
have been working well.&nbsp;The results are shown below:</p>
                <p>Loop
1 was a flow loop.&nbsp;The valve was 3 times oversized with 14%
hysteresis.&nbsp;As discussed in the Loop Signature series, good
control is difficult to achieve with valves oversized by more than a
factor of 2.&nbsp;As far as the other problem is concerned, control
valves should not exhibit more than 1% hysteresis.&nbsp;With 14%
hysteresis on a hugely oversized valve, good control is
impossible.&nbsp;The tuning would have been good for a normal flow
loop, but in fact it is better to detune a flow loop with excessive
hysteresis.</p>
                <p>Figure
1 shows a closed loop test illustrating how long it takes to reverse
the valve after the first overshoot on a setpoint change.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    <table nof="TE" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
                        <tbody><tr>

                    <b>Figure 1</b></p>
                <p>Loops
2 and 3 consisted of a level and a very important density control
system, and were very interactive.&nbsp;In actual fact what was
required was only a density control.&nbsp;The control strategy was
unworkable, and a better and more workable strategy was suggested.</p>
                <p>Loop
4 was a flow loop.&nbsp;The valve had 13% hysteresis and the tuning was
about 10 times slower than it should have been.&nbsp;Once again the
control could be vastly improved if the valve was replaced.</p>
                <p>Loop
5, another flow loop, was completely detuned.&nbsp;The correct tuning
was literally hundreds of times faster.&nbsp; In addition it was found
that when the controller output was at zero, the minimum flow was at
32% of the span.&nbsp; Either the valve was passing, or it was stroked
incorrectly.&nbsp;Figure 2 shows the difference in response with
firstly the new tuning and secondly the original tuning.</p>

                <p>Loop
6 was a level control.&nbsp;Initial closed loop "as found" tests showed
the control was hopeless.&nbsp;Fortunately there was a flow indicator
in series with the control valve.&nbsp;Tests showed firstly that the
flow saturated at about 80% of the valve opening.&nbsp;(This is shown
in Figure 3).&nbsp;</p>

                    <b>Figure 3</b></p>
                <p>Good
control practice would dictate that the controller output should be
limited at this point to prevent reset windup.&nbsp;Secondly it was
found that the flow through the valve varied widely when the controller
was in manual and the output signal was kept constant.&nbsp;This was
most likely due to pressure variations in the pipeline.&nbsp;The
variations virtually made it impossible to achieve good control with
the existing loop set-up.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>To
solve this, it would be easy to add a secondary cascade control loop on
the flow, with the level controller feeding the setpoint of the flow
controller.&nbsp;This control loop would be much faster than the level,
and would allow the level controller to do a good job, as the flow
controller could now take charge of eliminating variations in flow due
to the pressure changes.&nbsp;(Refer Loop Signature article "How to
make a bad valve into a good valve").</p>
                <p>Loop
7 was a level loop.&nbsp;When examined it was found to be cycling badly
due to extremely bad tuning.&nbsp;Good tuning soon solved that
problem.&nbsp;One problem that still existed was that there was a very
high noise amplitude on the level signal.&nbsp;Unfortunately this was
being amplified in the controller as higher gains are generally needed
too achieve good "tight" level control.&nbsp;Although filters are very
undesirable it was suggested that one should be used in this case to
minimise excessive wear on the valve.</p>
                <p>It
was really interesting that not one loop was found to be working
properly in this audit on relatively simple loops.&nbsp;One must assume
that if these are not operating properly then there is little chance
that the slower more critical loops will be any better.</p>
                <p>It makes one wonders how many probably hundreds of millions of Rands this plant has lost with bad control over the decades.<br><br><a href="http://www.controlloop.co.za/Case_histories/case_histories.html">Index to articles</a></p>
