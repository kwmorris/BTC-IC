      <P>An inherent phenomenon occurring in most control valves that few people 
      are aware of is "stick-slip".&nbsp; This is illustrated in the test on a 
      valve shown in Figure 1.

      <P><B><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-2>Figure 
1</FONT></B>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>In this test, the 
      input signal to the valve was ramped up 2.5% in 25 seconds, down 5% in 50 
      seconds, and up 2.5% in 25 seconds. The ramp rate for the test was a 1% 
      change in 10 seconds. This ramp rate change in valve position is therefore 
      equivalent to a 100% valve change in 16.7 minutes, which in anybody's 
      reckoning can be considered as reasonably slow.
      <P>It can be seen that when the ramp initially started and every time it 
      changed direction, the valve initially didn't move, and after a while gave 
      a little jump or "pop".&nbsp; This is known as stick-slip.
      <P>Stick-slip response in a valve is typically the result of a difference 
      in the static and sliding friction in the valve assembly.&nbsp; It occurs 
      mainly on valves positioned by means of diaphragm-spring actuators, and is 
      caused by an imbalance in the dynamic forces when reversing the 
      valve.&nbsp; The first time the valve is moved in the opposite direction 
      static friction arises, as explained in a previous article.&nbsp; The air 
      pressure to the diaphragm is increased to overcome the static friction, as 
      the valve cannot move until it is overcome.&nbsp; This is referred to as 
      the "stick phase".&nbsp; Once the static frictional force is overcome, the 
      force necessary to move the valve further is now lower.&nbsp; This is due 
      to the fact that the sliding frictional forces are much smaller than the 
      static frictional forces. At the instant the static friction is overcome, 
      there is still some remaining energy in excess, which is now pushing 
      against the weaker sliding frictional force.&nbsp; This results in the 
      valve popping to a new position.&nbsp; This is known as the "slip phase".
      <P>Stick-slip in general has no serious effect on integrating or slower 
      self regulating loops, but is instrumental in creating a closed loop 
      cycle, which is found on about 15% of all fast self regulating loops that 
      are tuned with a reasonable response.
      <P>A typical stick-slip cycle is shown in Figure 2.

      <P><B><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-2>Figure 
2</FONT></B>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>This is a recording 
      of an oil flow taken in a petrochemical refinery, and is a final closed 
      loop test after new tuning was inserted in the controller. At the start of 
      the recording the PV (flow signal) is stationery at about 1% below set 
      point, and the valve is in the stick phase.&nbsp; The controller (PD) is 
      trying to eliminate the error, and its output is ramping upwards under the 
      integral action.&nbsp; Eventually there is sufficient energy in the 
      actuator to overcome the static friction, and the valve starts moving, as 
      can be seen by the rapidly decreasing flow.&nbsp; As the valve moves it 
      also slips, and it ends up on the opposite side of the setpoint, where the 
      whole process starts again in the reverse direction.&nbsp; This becomes a 
      type of limit cycle, with a typically squarish waveform on the PV, and a 
      triangular waveform on the PD.
      <P>The reason why this is found mostly on fast self regulating processes 
      (typically flow loops), is because the ideal pole cancelled tuning for 
      such processes is very low gain, and fast integral.&nbsp; (On simple first 
      order lag, deadtime, self-regulating processes, the integral is normally 
      set equal to the dominant lag of the process).&nbsp; During the stick 
      phase the integral term is ramping and in fact it pushes the controller 
      output (PD) too far.&nbsp; This is effectively a little bit of controller 
      "reset windup", a subject which will be dealt with in detail in a future 
      series of loop signatures on controllers.&nbsp; In any event this is a 
      major factor contributing to the cycle.
      <P>The stick-slip cycle is definitely a valve problem and not a tuning 
      problem.&nbsp; However, and very unfortunately, due to the general 
      complete lack of practical control training by institutions who teach 
      control, virtually nobody in the field are aware of this.&nbsp; As a 
      result, whenever a stick-slip cycle is encountered in a plant (which, as 
      mentioned above, can be on as many as 15% of all fast self regulating 
      processes), most people think it is unstable tuning, and completely and 
      utterly detune the loop until the cycle stops.&nbsp; At that stage the 
      control has virtually stopped as well.&nbsp; As a typical example, in the 
      week I am writing this I have encountered 3 flow loops with inherent 
      stick-slip cycles in a paper plant.&nbsp; On the closed loop&nbsp; 
      tests&nbsp; with the original "as found" tuning, both took close on an 
      hour to respond fully to a 10% change of setpoint.
      <P>I have sometimes heard control engineers arguing that flow loops need 
      not be tuned fast, as their speed of response is still much faster than 
      general plant responses.&nbsp; If they believe that flow loops taking 20 
      minutes or longer to respond to a 10% setpoint change will not affect 
      control, then I reject their argument absolutely.&nbsp; The function of 
      regulatory control loops on continuous process plants is mainly to 
      minimise variance at all stages of production.&nbsp; Typically many flow 
      loops are cascade secondaries which need to be much faster than their 
      primaries.&nbsp; (By fast tuning I am not necessarily referring to quarter 
      amplitude damped response, but typically tuning with the gain margin 
      increased by 100% or more from this point).&nbsp; Our experience is that 
      the improvement in performance of properly optimised plants, is&nbsp; 
      beyond most people's belief.
      <P>It is common for people in this field to think that cycling in closed 
      loop feedback control systems are caused only by unstable tuning.&nbsp; In 
      reality, and in our courses, we teach at least 5 different reasons for 
      such cycling, which have nothing to do with poor tuning.
      <P>The solution to stick-slip cycling is a technique developed in the 
      United States by David Ender of Techmation Inc.&nbsp; He has given it the 
      rather awkward name "Dead Band Reset Scheduling", or DRS for short.&nbsp; 
      One writes a relatively simple routine into the PLC or DCS, whereby a band 
      can be placed equilaterally around setpoint, with amplitude slightly 
      larger than the amplitude of the stick-slip cycle.&nbsp; The integral 
      value (in terms of time per repeat) in the controller is increased by a 
      factor adjustable from 1 - 20 inside the gap.&nbsp; Normally a value of 
      about 8 -10 suffices.&nbsp; Thus, although the response to small load 
      changes is slower within the gap, any large load or setpoint changes that 
      result in the PV moving out of the gap, are still dealt with speedily, and 
      the overall control variance is orders of magnitude better than completely 
      detuning the controller.
