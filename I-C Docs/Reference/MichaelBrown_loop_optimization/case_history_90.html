                <p><b>TUNING IS ALSO IMPORTANT</b></p>
                <p>I
have very often pointed out in past articles that when optimising
control loops, the last step to be performed is the tuning. I also
mentioned that there is a strong perception amongst many, if not most,
plant personnel that any problem can be sorted out by tuning the
controller.</p>
                <p>It
is absolutely vital to go through many other steps to thoroughly
analyse the loop before the tuning can be carried out confidently. It
is essential to gain at least a basic understanding of the actual
process, and also a really thorough understanding of the control
requirements of the process including process dynamics, type of control
needed, etc. As mentioned many times before, and particularly in my
Loop Signature series of articles, each loop needs its own "optimum"
tune to satisfy the unique control requirements of that particular
process.&nbsp; The highly theoretical concept taught at nearly all
control schools that quarter wave, or quarter damped response is the
optimum tune that should always be used, is not practical for&nbsp; a
variety of very good reasons which are detailed in Loop Signature P1-24
in my CD, "Basic Troubleshooting and Loop Tuning". </p>
                <p>Possibly I have mistakenly
given the impression that tuning is not all that important. If so, I
apologise.&nbsp; It is certainly also of vital importance.&nbsp;
However it can generally only work well if one has gone through all the
previous steps of the analysis, to ensure that the most appropriate
tuning is used. </p>
                <p>Another point I often make
which is often derided by many people, is that in general in virtually
every single one of the many hundreds of process plants wherein my
colleagues and I have performed optimisation, we have found that at
least 85% of the loops are operating completely inefficiently in
automatic.&nbsp; Normally as far as tuning is concerned, most are
completely detuned (i.e. tuned far too slowly) to be effective.</p>
                <p>People
often take me to task on this and say that it would be impossible for
plants to operate like this.&nbsp; To site a recent example of this, I
met another consulting control engineer at a dinner. This gentleman has
had many years of experience in teaching, loop tuning, and advanced
control.&nbsp; He took me to task, and said that he has had as much
experience as I have, and basically that I was talking nonsense. I then
offered him a free place on one of my courses, so he could understand
why I say what I do. This he declined.&nbsp; I then offered to spend a
day free of charge (except for expenses at cost), at any plant of his
choosing, where he could arrange for us to do a free audit of some of
their loops, so we could see at the end of the day how many were
operating effectively. He has not taken me up on this challenge either.
</p>
                <p>Anyway in this article I would
like to illustrate a few cases in point where tuning is vital.&nbsp;
These were in a world class South African chemical plant that has been
running for a long time, and is supposed to be well optimised.&nbsp;
Certainly the leading technician who arranged the consultation has had
many years of experience, is a very intelligent person, and did say
that he thought he knew quite a bit about tuning.</p>
                <p>The
first example was the control of the feed gas to a reactor.&nbsp; They
were having a lot of problems with the reactor performance, one of
which was that the feed-flow was jumping around too much.&nbsp; The
process supervisor working with us on the optimisation said that things
would be a lot better if the control of this flow could be improved
made really fast.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>Initial
inspection of the loop showed the tuning parameters were way too slow.
A closed loop test is shown in Figure 1.&nbsp; It can be seen that on a
10% SP (set-point) change it took over an hour for the PV (process
variable) to reach the new setpoint! This is what I sometimes refer to
as tuning being "close to manual". </p>
                <p><img id="Picture3" src="case_history_90_files/cashis90Fig1.jpg" alt="cashis90Fig1" title="cashis90Fig1" align="top" border="0" height="442" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 1</i></p>
                <p>Figure
2 with the same time scale shows the same test with what I consider
relatively slow and stable new tuning.&nbsp; The flow now follows the
10% SP change within about 20 seconds. </p>
                <p><img id="Picture4" src="case_history_90_files/cashis90Fig2.jpg" alt="cashis90Fig2" title="cashis90Fig2" align="top" border="0" height="443" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 2</i></p>
                <p>The
new tuning worked extremely well.&nbsp; There were a lot of load
changes going on in and after the reactor, and the control was now
excellent for the reactor. However the next morning there were big
complaints from the supervisor of the plant upstream which supplied the
feed gas.&nbsp; Our flow control was working so well that the pressure
changes caused backwards upstream by the flow control valve operating
nice and quickly to keep the flow constant, was upsetting their
plant.&nbsp; (This was probably due to poor control performance in the
upstream plant).</p>
                <p>It
was therefore important to try and find a compromise, whereby the
control was slow enough to prevent upsetting the upstream plant, but
remaining fast enough to allow good control on the reactor.&nbsp; This
was achieved by reducing the speed of the control by about 50%.&nbsp; I
also recommended that the upstream plant should also be optimised.</p>
                <p>This
is a very good example which illustrates various things. Tuning is of
course very important.&nbsp; However there is no such thing as one
"optimum tune" like the classical quarter wave damping.&nbsp; You need
to understand what the control is there for, what can cause upsets
etc., and then determine the best tune to meet the conditions as well
as possible. This means that people have to really have a good
understanding of the process, and to understand exactly what they are
trying to achieve.&nbsp; Then again, tuning one loop without taking
other related processes and control loops into account is not a good
idea. You need to look holistically at the whole system. It is also a
good idea in general to start optimisation upstream, and work
downstream from there.</p>
                <p>The
second example is of a top temperature control in a distillation
column. The temperature is controlled by varying the reflux flow back
into the column, via a cascade slave flow controller. The column was in
a different plant on the site. I was called in by the process manager
on that particular plant who heard that I was on site, and wanted me to
look at some of the controls in his plant as he thought they could be
improved. His plant performance was in general pretty dismal, and he
felt that much of this might have been due to poor control, so he chose
this temperature control with which the operators were having a lot of
problems, to test his theory.</p>
                <p>The
slave flow loop was tested first.&nbsp; It was found that the valve was
very good, but the tuning was extremely slow.&nbsp; This is very bad
for a cascade secondary control. It was shown in the first loop
signature series on the above referenced CD, that the slave loop needs
to be at least 10 times faster than the master loop to prevent
interaction between the two controls.&nbsp; Therefore reasonably fast
tuning is a perquisite on such a loop.</p>
                <p>Figure
3 is quite interesting. It shows the response of the flow loop with the
original tuning and with the new tuning on the same graph, so the
tunings can be easily compared. &nbsp; As will be seen, the difference
is quite dramatic.</p>
                <p><img id="Picture5" src="case_history_90_files/cashis90Fig3.jpg" alt="cashis90Fig3" title="cashis90Fig3" align="top" border="0" height="443" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 3</i></p>
                <p>The
tuning of the temperature loop proved equally dramatic.&nbsp; Figure 4
shows the response to a small 3% set-point change. It has not reached
the new set-point after 2.5 hours.&nbsp; </p>
                <p><img id="Picture6" src="case_history_90_files/cashis90Fig4.jpg" alt="cashis90Fig4" title="cashis90Fig4" align="top" border="0" height="443" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 4</i></p>
                <p>In Figure 5, with the new tuning, one sees the loop responding to the same size of set-point change in only 5 minutes! </p>
                <p><img id="Picture7" src="case_history_90_files/cashis90Fig5.jpg" alt="cashis90Fig5" title="cashis90Fig5" align="top" border="0" height="443" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 5</i></p>
                <p>If
we assume that similar tuning probably exists on most of the other
loops in the same plant, one can see why the process manager was not
happy.</p>
                <p>I feel that things like this just "boggle
the mind". The plant belongs to a leading company.&nbsp; It has been
operating for years, and obviously makes good profits. There is no
shortage of skilled process and control personnel. So how is it
possible that it has been operating with controls in such a terrible
state for all those years, and that no-one was aware of the problems?</p>
                <p>In
spite of things like this which I see every day, people still say I am
talking nonsense and that it is impossible for plants to be operating
with controls in such a bad state.</p>
