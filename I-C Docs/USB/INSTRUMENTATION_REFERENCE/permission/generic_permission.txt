To Whom it may concern,
 
I teach Instrumentation at Bellingham Technical College, 
and am compiling a collection of tutorial and product 
datasheet files for student reference on CD-ROM.  I would 
like formal permission to copy some of your ??? to these 
CD-ROM disks for my students (http://www.???).
 
The reason for doing this is to provide off-line references for 
students to take home and view on their own computers.  Many students 
lack internet service, or are restricted to slow dial-up connections, 
and so cannot effectively make use of your ??? on line.
 
Please understand that these CD-ROMs will be used strictly for 
academic purposes, and will not be used in commercial applications 
of any sort.  If this is acceptable to you, please send me written 
permission to copy and distribute these ??? by way of 
email, and I will include this letter of permission on the CD-ROMs 
along with the downloaded documents.
 
Thank you for your time and attention in this matter.
 
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Tony Kuphaldt
