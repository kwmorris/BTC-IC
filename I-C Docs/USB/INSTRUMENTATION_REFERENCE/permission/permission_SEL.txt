Subject:        Permission to copy and distribute PDF documents to students

Hello,

I am an instructor of Instrumentation and Control 
Technology at Bellingham Technical College in 
Bellingham, Washington.  In the interest of 
incorportating some basic coverage of protective 
relay technology into the Instrumenation curriculum 
beginning this academic year, I would like to 
assign some of your PDF manuals and papers freely 
available on the SEL website as reading material 
for my students.  Since some of my students have 
limited internet access, I would like to copy 
some of these files to CD-ROM media for offline 
access, distributing these CD-ROM disks to students.

These disks will be used for educational purposes 
only and will not be sold.  If these terms are 
agreeable to you, please reply with explicit 
permission to copy and distribute these files for 
student use.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me 
at my work phone or email, or simply by replying 
to this message sent from my personal email:
