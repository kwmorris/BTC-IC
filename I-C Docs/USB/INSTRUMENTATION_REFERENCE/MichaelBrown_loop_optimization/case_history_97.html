<p class="MsoBodyText">Monsters (a.k.a. difficult problems) are lurking beneath the surface in the
strange and sometimes scary world that is the control system in a
plant. The water is so murky that plant personnel trying to find their
way through it, often cannot see the monsters hiding in the nooks and
crannies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the educational institutions that teach
control generally talk to their students in the pure clean language of
mathematics, which doesn&#8217;t recognise murky waters or acknowledge the
presence of monsters. As a result, young control engineers and
technicians arrive in a plant in a state of virginal and blissful
ignorance thinking that they can now apply all the wonderful theory
that they have sweated and strived for years to learn, and they hope to
really improve plant performance.</p>

<p>This reminds me of the story of a dear American friend of mine, Dave,
who is today the greatest exponent of control loop optimisation in the
world. As a very young engineer with a recently completed M.Sc. in
control engineering, his first task when he started working at a large
plant was to tune a loop that had been giving trouble. (Remember I
always talk about that great fallacy: &#8220;Any control problem can be fixed
by tuning the controller&#8221;).</p>

<p> The evening before tackling the task, Dave got out his university
notes, and studied up all the good things he had learnt about tuning,
including all sorts of complicated maths and frequency plots, and
arrived bright and early the next morning in the control room, and told
the operator that he was there to tune the errant loop. The operator
told him to go ahead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I can do that I need the process transfer function&#8221; said Dave.</p>

<p>&#8220;The what?&#8221; responded the puzzled Operator.</p>

<p>Dave:  &#8220;The process transfer function.  You know, the equation that describes the dynamics of the process&#8221;.</p>

<p>Operator (now thoroughly confused):  &#8220;Dynamics?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave:  &#8220;Yes, dynamics are the way the process output responds to a change on the input&#8221;.</p>

<p>Operator: &#8220;This must be something new. In the past the guys just tuned
the loop by playing with the knobs on the controller. Why don&#8217;t you pop
down to engineering or stores, and see if they can help you?&#8221;</p>

<p>So the fledgling young control engineer was awakened to the real world,
and was sadly disillusioned. When he told me this story years later, he
said that he had really been upset. After spending many years studying
control, and on the first day at the new job, he discovered that his
speciality was the only branch of science where you can&#8217;t use the
theory behind it.</p>

<p>Not being a man to surrender lightly, Dave went on to develop powerful
tools that would allow one to optimise loops. These tools do employ a
lot of the theory, and make it easy for less skilled practitioners to
do this work.</p>

<p>In reality the theory is without doubt brilliant. It was originally
developed by incredibly clever mathematicians who had probably never
seen a process plant. It follows laws of nature, and does in fact work
extremely well, provided that everything in the loop is OK. I love to
watch perfectly optimised controls working in plants. It never ceases
to amaze me how well the theory does work in practice, if everything is
set-up correctly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in the real world, very few people understand the
practicalities and necessary procedures that must be carried out to get
feedback control systems to work properly. It is not just a question of
tuning. This is the last thing that should be done. One must firstly
understand all aspects of the control, including process aspects, and
the type of tuning required. Then one must analyse the loop to uncover
problems, to be able to kill any lurking monsters, and also to gain
understanding how to go about tuning the controller. Finally one must
apply the best tuning to give the response that will meet the control
requirements for that particular process.</p>

<p>In most plants tuning is carried out as a solution to all problems. It
is performed in 98% of all cases world-wide by trial and error, very
often by unskilled people, and in the vast majority of cases it leads
to extremely poor and inefficient control. The opportunity for
improvement in this field is therefore truly vast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was recently asked to perform some optimisation work in a large
chemical plant which has been running for over 15 years. The process
engineers had a profound mistrust of the controls. In spite of most of
them having completed control courses during their university courses,
none of them knew very much about control, and they relied heavily on
their Control and Instrumentation (C&amp;I) department.</p>

<p>Within a relatively few hours work in the plant I was able to establish
that the state of the control was in a very poor condition. Typically
most of the loops still had the original default controller settings
that had come with the DCS from the manufacturer. (This in a plant that
has been running for 15 years!) Many loops were in manual, and most of
those running in automatic were so badly detuned that the operators
always made changes in manual, and then set the controllers back to
automatic when everything was steady again. There didn&#8217;t seem to be
anyone in the plant who really understood how to make changes to
control loops in the DCS. The most the C&amp;I people could do was
change the controllers&#8217; parameter values.</p>

<p>This state of affairs is really amazing. People try and produce
products using incredibly expensive devices like DCS&#8217;s, yet do not
bother to try and get them to work properly. Yet another fallacy is
that computers can do no wrong. &#8220;If we have spent millions of Rands or
dollars on a highly sophisticated computerised control device, surely
it doesn&#8217;t need specialised people to make it work properly?&#8221;</p>

<p>I will show one interesting example of a control system with a monster
lurking in it. This was a level control with a cascaded flow loop to
look after the valve. The control requirement was that the level be
kept as constant as possible at setpoint. Large load changes occurred
frequently. The loop was normally run in manual, and was a bane in the
life of the operators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Level loops are integrating processes, and as discussed in many
previous articles, integrating processes need to be balanced if they
are to stay in equilibrium. If not they run away as they are inherently
unstable. Thus if such a loop is in manual, it necessitates the poor
old operator having to continually return to the loop every few minutes
to see if its running away, and to apply corrections.)</p>

                <p class="MsoBodyText" align="center"><img src="case_history_97_files/Fig_1.jpg" width="600" height="446" border="0"><br>
                <i>Fig 1</i></p>
    
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left">
A portion of the open loop test on the cascade flow loop is shown in
Figure 1. The first point to note is that the valve is about 3,5 times
oversized. This can be seen from the ratio of the size of the change in
the PV (process variable) to the size of the step change in the PD
(process demand), which caused the change. (This ratio is known as the
process gain, which has been covered in many previous articles as well
as in the Loop Signature series).</p>

<p>Oversized valves will perforce operate much closer to seat, and in this
case where there was a fairly low load going through the vessel the
valve was operating very close to seat. In the open loop test shown in
Figure 1, it can be seen that the PD is being stepped down in smallish
steps starting at about 18%. The flow which started at about 78%
followed down reasonably well in a fairly linear fashion. However when
the PD was at 1% the PV was still at 35%. When the PD was reduced to
zero the PV also went to zero in one large step. This is a huge
potential for instability if the valve has to control flows down in
that region. Obviously there is also something terribly wrong with a
valve that changes the flow from 35% to zero on a 1% step. It could be
a symptom of a very worn seat.</p>

<p>In general it is a fairly well known fact that one should not try and
control under normal circumstances with the control valve position
below 20%. This is an excellent example why this is so. In this
unfortunate loop the balance point of the level was with the flow
relatively low, and with the oversized valve working so close to seat
it was very easy to get into the low unstable region.</p>

            <p class="MsoBodyText" align="center"><img src="case_history_97_files/Fig_2.jpg" width="600" height="446" border="0"><br>
            <i>Fig 2</i></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left">This is nicely illustrated in Figure 2 which shows a closed loop final test
with relatively good tuning. A setpoint change was made to increase the
level in the tank. The valve which is on the input to the tank, shut
off to raise the level quickly. The level started rising nicely but as
the valve started opening to restore balance, it moved into the
unstable region and the flow loop went completely unstable. This
stabilised as soon as the PD got past the 1% opening, and then the
control worked well again.</p> 

Unfortunately there is nothing much one can do in this situation except to replace the valve with a smaller
one, or to reduce its trim.</p>

<p>A point of note is that the C&amp;I people had completely detuned the
flow controller to try and stop the cycling. The controller was so slow
that there was no way that the level could be controlled. This is
another beautiful example of how people tend to believe that tuning can
solve all problems, and never go looking for the monsters lurking
beneath the surface.</p>
