                            <p style="text-align: left;">A
few months ago I was commissioned to optimise the controls of two large
reheat furnaces in a steel manufacturing plant.&nbsp;The client was
aware that furnaces were consuming gas at a rate which was very much
higher than comparative figures they had obtained world wide from other
manufacturers.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Their
plan was to change over the control of the furnaces from an old DCS
system to a well known make of PLC.&nbsp;The technical staff in the
plant were mostly of the electrical discipline, and had a rather
limited knowledge of feedback control.&nbsp;The change-over was to be
conducted over the Christmas period when the furnaces would be shut
down for three weeks.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>It
was decided that components such as valves and regulators would be
serviced during the shutdown.&nbsp;Very fortunately (as will be seen
later), the plant had installed flowmeters in most air and gas lines,
and it was agreed that I would check the valves' performances prior to
the shut-down, so that the valve contractors would have a better idea
of what to do on them during the service.&nbsp; I was then to return
after the shut-down to optimise the actual controls.</p>
                            <p>Each
of the furnaces has 3 independently controlled zones, each supplied
with gas and air mixture.&nbsp;The main controls are the temperature in
each zone which operate by varying the flow of air and gas in a certain
ratio.&nbsp;There are also several other ancillary controls, the most
important being furnace pressure which is controlled by a damper
situated before the furnace-stack exhaust fan.</p>
                            <p>This article will deal with valves problems encountered mostly on the initial visit.</p>
                            <p>In
many of my articles both in the Case Histories series and in the Loop
Signature series, problems caused by poor valves have been
described.&nbsp;It was also mentioned that about 86% of problems
encountered in control loops are due to valves.&nbsp;Another factor is
that plants often use poor valves that are not really designed as
proper modulating control valves. One reason for this is because proper
control valves are very much more expensive.&nbsp;Poor valves also
often used in plants where the personnel do not have much knowledge and
experience of control.</p>
                            <p>It
has been stressed that it is extremely difficult to achieve good
control with bad valves.&nbsp;In particular as slow processes can only
be tuned slowly to match the dynamics, good performance of the valve is
absolutely critical.&nbsp;In Loop Signature 17, it was shown that one
way to overcome many of the valve problems on slow processes is to use
a cascade flow secondary which acts much quicker than the temperature
loop, so that all the temperature controller has to do is to set the
setpoint of the flow controller, which in turn because of its faster
speed, can overcome many of the valve problems in a relatively short
time, and thus ensure that the correct flow of product is fed to the
process in accordance with the demands of the temperature controller.</p>
                            <p>In
this particular plant the valves were not really proper modulating
control valves, and in fact as will be seen below, most of the valves
were so bad that they presented problems which are amongst the worst I
have ever encountered in a plant.&nbsp;Fortunately the plant had
installed flow meters in most loops so that cascade control could be
used.&nbsp;Any form of reasonable temperature control would have been
virtually impossible without these.&nbsp;Six of the worst examples are
shown.</p>
                            <p>All
the tests shown in the following examples (apart from Figure 5) are
open loop tests where equal steps were made on the controller output
(PD) in both directions.</p>
                            <p>Figure 1
shows the test on a heating gas flow control loop.&nbsp;On the first
step when opening the valve, it overshot slightly.&nbsp;It oscillated
very slightly on the way up on the second step, and took longer getting
the flow to the correct place, as it did on the first step. </p>
                            <p>
                                <table nof="TE" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Figure 1</i></p>
                            <p>The
loop was then subjected to a series of steps in the closing
direction.&nbsp;It can be seen that after the first step in this
direction, the valve appeared to oscillate on each step.&nbsp;This got
increasingly worse the closer the valve got near its seat.&nbsp;It
would appear that the positioner was unable to cope with the forces
there, and became increasingly unstable, until it did actually go into
complete instability when the process demand signal was zero, and it
was actually impossible to stop the flow.</p>
                            <p>Another
thing that can be seen in the test by observing the relative sizes of
the steps of process variable and demand, is that the valve is roughly
twice oversized.&nbsp;(This is not too serious.&nbsp;However we
recommend that this is about the absolute limit of oversizing to
prevent the possible deleterious effects that can be encountered with
badly oversized valves).</p>
                            <p>This valve is very bad and is unable to control at low flows.</p>
                            <p>Figure
2 is a test on another heating gas flow control loop.&nbsp;The first
step down is very much larger than any other step.&nbsp;The flow was
then reversed and at the step up to a flow of 75%, a huge overshoot
followed by damped cycling was observed.&nbsp;The last two steps were
very much smaller than any of the previous ones, and the very last was
smaller than the previous.&nbsp;Positioner overshoot is now evident in
both these steps.</p>

                            <p>The
test illustrates that the valve is very non-repeatable, and one needs a
repeatable valve to achieve any sort of reasonable control.</p>
                            <p>Figure
3 shows a test on an airflow control loop.&nbsp;It can be clearly seen
that the valve displays excessive hysteresis (caused by stiction and/or
deadband).&nbsp;This measured a vast 28%!&nbsp;The maximum acceptable
hysteresis on a control valve is 1%.&nbsp;In addition the valve moved
different amounts in a non-repeatable way on most steps, and when the
PD was at zero, 40% of the flow was still passing through the
valve.&nbsp;Really terrible.</p>

                            <p>A
test on another gas heating flow is shown in Figure 4.&nbsp;The valve
displays none of the same problems the other valves had, but has very
non-linear installed characteristics.&nbsp;This is extremely bad for
uniform control action in a cascade secondary loop, which normally has
to work over a wide range.</p>

                            <p>Figure
5 is the gas supply pressure to one of the furnaces.&nbsp;A high
frequency oscillation of about 1.5 seconds, with an 11% amplitude can
be seen.&nbsp; This was caused by the incoming gas supply pressure
regulator being mounted too close to the control valve.&nbsp;There is
insufficient capacity in the gas line downstream of the regulator to
take up pressure variations, and the regulator is operating in a
unstable state.&nbsp;Close coupling of pressure regulators is a fairly
common fault found in plants, and it often results in this instability.</p>

                            <p>I
think it is pretty obvious that one could not expect any form of
reasonable control with these valves.&nbsp; Remember a valve's job is
to translate the demand of the controller into a flow of a
fluid.&nbsp;If it cannot do this, one must cannot expect decent
control.&nbsp;Even a flow controller really operates far too slowly to
overcome valve problems in an acceptable time.&nbsp; In the case of
slow processes like temperature, a controller can literally take many
hours to correct for a valve's problems. </p>
