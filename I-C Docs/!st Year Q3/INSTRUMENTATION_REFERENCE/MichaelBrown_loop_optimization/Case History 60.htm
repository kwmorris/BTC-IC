            <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica>Do mines have 
            particularly bad control problems? </FONT></B>
            <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>In the far 
            distant past when I first started my own business we specialised in 
            automating plants mainly on gold and platinum mines.&nbsp; Even 
            inexperienced as I was in those days, I soon realised that the task 
            was far from easy.&nbsp; 
            <P>Over the past few months I have been optimising controls in 
            mining applications including zinc and platinum mines.&nbsp; Once 
            again I have come to the conclusion that controls operating in 
            mining environments have to cater with some unique and specialised 
            problems that are not encountered in many other industries.&nbsp; 
            Amongst these are the facts that mining is a rough business with 
            plant constructed very robustly in order to deal with extremely 
            harsh operating conditions, and process control is a factor that is 
            relatively far down on the list of design considerations when 
            construction takes place.&nbsp; Products are also usually far from 
            consistent.&nbsp; Typically ore varies considerably in physical 
            properties including consistency, size, density, and moisture 
            content amongst many others.&nbsp; It is also extremely abrasive, 
            which makes it hard to measure it, and severely limits one choice of 
            suitable final control elements.
            <P>Measuring physical and chemical properties in mining is also 
            often extremely difficult.&nbsp; Many parameters that require 
            measuring present unique problems.&nbsp; To take a few examples, 
            slurries are extremely abrasive, and there are only a few materials 
            that can withstand such abrasion.&nbsp; One often has to measure 
            levels of fluids that vary from abrasive and viscous, to liquids 
            that are covered by a layer of foam that is almost as dense as the 
            liquid itself.&nbsp; A couple of years ago I worked on the control 
            of cyanide addition, where the sampling type cyanide concentration 
            analyser, had a scan (update) time of 17 minutes!&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
            more modern versions have managed to reduce this time to about 9 
            minutes, which still introduces quite a long dead time for an 
            important measurement being used in a feedback control system.
            <P>Process non-linearity is often the norm, rather than the 
            exception.&nbsp; Plants sometimes behave completely differently from 
            day to day. 
            <P>All these factors present some severe challenges when trying to 
            optimise processes in mining applications.
            <P>The mining industry also tends to perform controls using the PLC 
            and SCADA approach rather than using DCS's.&nbsp; Apart from cost 
            saving, this is logical as the digital IO count in most mining 
            applications is very high as compared with analogue IO's.&nbsp; 
            However from the regulatory control point of view, PLC's in general 
            are mostly very limited as compared with the DCS.&nbsp; Also the 
            fact that they are so extremely versatile often creates problems on 
            the analogue control side.&nbsp; This appears to be a complete 
            oxymoron, but the fact is that definitive structures exists when 
            laying out control loops in DCS's, which is not the case with most 
            PLC's.&nbsp; People programme control loops the way they wish, and 
            often as they are not really familiar with control practicalities, 
            they do things which adversely affect the control.&nbsp; Also over 
            the years, different people work on the programme and make 
            changes.&nbsp; It is often extremely difficult to try and find out 
            exactly what is happening in the control loop and control 
            strategy.&nbsp; 
            <P>Apart from this it may sometimes be very difficult to perform 
            optimisation procedures on PLC control systems, as the programmer 
            may have not allowed for structures typically to change from Auto to 
            Manual, and from Local to Remote setpoint as examples.&nbsp; Many 
            times in my career, I have wasted hours if not days in plants 
            waiting for people to try and sort out simple things like this on 
            PLC's.&nbsp; On one famous occasion it took 3 weeks to locate a 
            large filter buried deep in a sub-routine in the programme, on a 
            critical control loop.
            <P>Another interesting example of bad programming was a case on a 
            smelter furnace pressure control, where the control valve should 
            never close completely.&nbsp; The loop had never been in 
            manual.&nbsp; After switching it into manual we performed the 
            necessary open loop tests, and then switched back to Auto with the 
            new tuning.&nbsp; Unfortunately for no known reason, the programmer 
            has included a sub-routine to initially close the valve when 
            switching from Manual to Auto.&nbsp; This resulted in a minor 
            explosion which cost the plant close on R100,000 in replacing all 
            their safety bursting plates and in lost production.
            <P>In this article I have included a few interesting examples of 
            control problems found recently on mines.
            <P>Figure 1 shows a&nbsp; closed loop test on a simple flow loop 
            where a setpoint change was made with the "as found" tuning.&nbsp; 
            This illustrates typically bad tuning with the proportional gain too 
            high, and the integral far too slow.&nbsp; The result as can be seen 
            is a cyclic response with the process variable not getting to 
            setpoint.</FONT></P></TD>

            <P>Figure 2 shows a similar closed loop test on another flow

            <P>Figure 3 is the open loop test on this loop.&nbsp; It displays 2 
            serious problems , namely the valve is over 3 times oversized (the 
            process gain is given by the ratio of PV step size to PD step size), 
            and it exhibits serious negative hysteresis with the valve 
            overshooting badly on reversals.&nbsp; This is a sign of an 
            underpowered actuator.&nbsp; (Process gain and negative hysteresis 
            have already been covered in detail in my Loop Signature 
            series).</FONT></P></TD></TR>

            <P>When one finds these characteristics present on a valve, the 
            control will tend to cycle with a large amplitude.&nbsp; Figure 4 
            shows the best result that could be obtained without completely 
            detuning the loop.&nbsp; The cycle is now a "stick-slip" cycle 
            of&nbsp; some 8% amplitude.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is due to the valve 
            problems and is not a tuning problem.&nbsp; Such cycles, will be 
            discussed in a future Loop Signature article.&nbsp; In this 
            particular&nbsp; case, the valve really need replacing with a 
            smaller one with larger actuator.</FONT></P></TD>

            <P>The last example here is a very interesting and very unusual one 
            of flow loop with a valve that exhibited strange sticking 
            characteristics which were not observable in the open loop 
            test.&nbsp; Figure 5 illustrates a series of setpoint step changes

            <P>It can be seen that on every setpoint change, the output of the 
            controller responded with its normal proportional change followed by 
            the integral ramp.&nbsp; However the actual valve did not move at 
            all until the output had moved some 5%.&nbsp; This caused an 18 
            second delay before the process started responding to the setpoint 
            change.
            <P>Things like this can and do cause havoc in control systems, and 
            one tends to find a lot of them in mining applications.</FONT>
