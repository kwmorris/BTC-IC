      "Signatures"<BR>Process dynamics - deadtime and simple lags</FONT></B> 
      <FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>
      <P>In the previous article dealing with process dynamics, process gain was 
      discussed. Two further important dynamic factors occurring in the majority 
      of process responses are deadtime and the first order lag.
      <P>Deadtime in a process is defined as the amount of time after a change 
      is made in the input to the process before there is any change in the 
      process output measurement. Deadtime in processes are typically the result 
      of transportation delay.&nbsp; Figure 1 depicts a mass feeder conveyor, 
      where the belt is moving at a given rate.&nbsp; </FONT>

          <TD><IMG id=Picture40 height=353 alt="Figure 1"

        border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>The process deadtime 
      is the time taken from when the material leaves the hopper until it 
      reaches the measurement transmitter. Processes with long deadtimes 
      compared to the process time lags (see below), require relatively fast 
      integral times and very small proportional gains in the controllers.
      <P>Deadtime is the "enemy" of feedback control, as it results in phase 
      lag, and hence possible instability in a loop that is tuned too 
      fast.&nbsp; To counter deadtime one has to insert less gain in the 
      controller.&nbsp; This means deadtime dominant loops (see definition 
      below), have to be tuned more slowly.&nbsp; This is a reason&nbsp; why the 
      D (derivative) parameter should never be used in the control of such 
      processes.
      <P>In fast processes, like flow and low capacity or hydraulic pressure 
      loops, the controller scan rate adds deadtime to the process. Therefore 
      controllers with slow scan rates, when used on fast processes, can make 
      these types of processes act as deadtime dominant loops, resulting in the 
      need to detune the controller.
      <P>There is a common misconception that deadtime dominant processes cannot 
      be controlled with PID controllers.&nbsp; This is completely 
      incorrect.&nbsp; A PID controller on such a process can be tuned so that 
      the process can fully respond to a step change in setpoint within 
      approximately two deadtimes.&nbsp; However, in reality, if the deadtime is 
      long, this is slow.
      <P>In real life situations, the majority of controllers are there to deal 
      with load changes as opposed to set point changes, and the problem that 
      often occurs in deadtime dominant processes is that load changes occur too 
      frequently and too fast for the controller to be able to catch these 
      changes.&nbsp; In such situations it may be necessary to re-examine the 
      control strategy and to try and find alternatives.
      <P>A first order lag is illustrated in Figure 2.</FONT>

          <TD><IMG id=Picture41 height=352 alt="Figure 2"

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>It is an exponential 
      response to a step change on the process input. The lag is measured by its 
      "time constant".&nbsp; A pure lag reaches 63.2% of its total change in one 
      time constant. The time constant value is not affected by the size of the 
      step.
      <P>Lags in a response are a function of the resistance and capacitance of 
      the process.&nbsp; In this example, the resistance is the orifice in the 
      valve restricting the gas flow, and the capacitance is the volume of pipe 
      the gas must fill to increase the pressure.
      <P>On fast processes like flow, the process dynamics are largely 
      determined by the valve dynamics.&nbsp; Most pneumatically operated valves 
      respond to step changes exponentially, as opposed to electric motor driven 
      valves which respond in a ramp fashion.
      <P>The first order lag response is very common, and the vast majority of 
      processes found in industrial control generally incorporate at least one 
      such lag.
      <P>The first order lag is also commonly used to provide a "filter" or 
      "damping" function in control loops.&nbsp; Most process transmitters, and 
      controllers offer a filter feature to allow one to&nbsp; reduce or 
      suppress noise that has entered the process variable measurement.&nbsp; It 
      should be noted that when a filter function is employed in the 
      transmitter, or controller, to "smooth" the recorded process variable 
      measurement signal, the controller does not act on the true response of 
      the process, as the filter adds lag time to the PV signal.&nbsp; Much will 
      be said about the potential disadvantages and dangers of using filters in 
      a later article in this series.
      <P>The relationship between time constant and deadtime is very 
      important.&nbsp; Generally processes with deadtimes smaller than the time 
      constant of the dominant lag are easier to control.&nbsp; A process with 
      the deadtime smaller than one tenth of the dominant lag, may classed as a 
      "pure lag only" process which is a&nbsp; deadtime free process.
      <P>Without any deadtime, a pure lag process cannot become unstable as the 
      phase angle can never reach -180<SUP>o</SUP>.&nbsp; This means it can be 
      can be virtually tuned as fast as one wishes.&nbsp; Typically pure 
      lag&nbsp; processes are encountered in real life on certain self 
      regulating temperature processes where one lag is significantly larger 
      than any other.
      <P>Processes with a deadtime longer than the time constant of the dominant 
      lag are said to be "deadtime dominant", and are considered more difficult 
      to control.&nbsp; This is due to the fact that one must "detune" deadtime 
      dominant processes for reasons of stability as discussed above.
      <P>It is of significant interest to note that after 5 years of intensive 
      empirical research in the 1930's, Ziegler and Nicholls only managed to 
      come up with fairly "rough" tuning methods for simple self regulating 
      processes with process gain, deadtime, and lag, and where the lag was 
      larger than the deadtime.&nbsp; Even today, many of the published tuning 
      methods, self tuning controllers, and commercial tuning packages on the 
      market can only deal with similar simple dynamics.
      <P>On integrating processes like level controls, the lags are usually 
      insignificant and play little role in the dynamics of the process.&nbsp; 
      However on certain types of integrating processes, particularly like large 
      capacity pressure control systems, and in certain types of integrating 
      temperature processes like end-point control (also commonly referred to as 
      batch temperature processes), a large lag is present which has a 
      significant effect on the dynamics.
      <P>Figure 3 illustrates such a process.&nbsp; </FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>Instead of the 
      integrating process going straight into a ramp when the balance is 
      disturbed, as in a level loop, it slowly curves up into the ramp as seen 
      in the diagram.&nbsp; This is due to the lag.
      <P>A noteworthy point is that this is one of the only two cases of process 
      dynamics where one should use the D term in the controller.&nbsp; In this 
      particular case, the D can make a really significant improvement to the 
      control response, typically increasing the speed of response by as much as 
      a factor of four.&nbsp; The value of D is set equal to the time constant 
      of the lag, and this effectively cancels the lag, particularly if the 
      controller is using a series algorithm.&nbsp; See article on controller 
      algorithms later in the series.
      <P>As mentioned in the previous article in this series, there are many 
      other types of more complicated dynamic responses that are commonly found 
      in industrial processes.&nbsp; These include multiple lags, higher order 
      lags, and positive and negative leads which all play a significant part in 
      the control of such processes. These dynamic factors are beyond the scope 
      of these articles.&nbsp; However it is essential that people who are 
      serious about optimisation study techniques in dealing with the control of 
      processes with such difficult dynamics. (Our Part 2 course on practical 
      control deals extensively with this subject).
