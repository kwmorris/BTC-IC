To Whom it may Concern, 

I am an instructor of instrumentation at Bellingham 
Technical College in Washington state, and am in the 
process of compiling a reference CD-ROM for my 
students' use.  Having an "offline" reference is 
important for students who do not have fast internet 
service, or internet service at all at their homes.  
I am interested in copying the following PDF catalog 
files from your website and copying them on to these
disks: 

    * Gaugeable Tube Fittings and Adapter Fittings 

    * Instrument Manifolds 

Please let me know if this use of your material 
would be permissible.  The CD-ROMs will not be sold, 
and they will only be used for students' educational 
purposes.  Of course I will give proper attribution 
to you as the author and provider of this material 
on the CD-ROM.  Thank you for your time and 
consideration.

Sincerely, 

Tony Kuphaldt
