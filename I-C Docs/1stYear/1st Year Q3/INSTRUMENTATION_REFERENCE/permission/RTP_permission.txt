To Whom it may concern,

I am an instructor of Instrumentation at Bellingham Technical College, and am in
the process of compiling a set of tutorial and product datasheet files for
student reference on CD-ROM.  Some of the literature provided for free download
on your website is of interest to my students, and I would like to formally
request permission to copy and distribute these electronic documents on CD-ROM
media.  Specifically, I am interested in several of your "whitepapers" in PDF
format.

The reason for doing this is to provide off-line references for students to take
home and view on their own computers.  Many students lack internet service, or
are restricted to slow dial-up connections, and so cannot effectively make use
of your free technical resources on line.

Please understand that these CD-ROMs will be used strictly for academic
purposes, and will not be used in commercial applications of any sort.  If this
is acceptable to you, please send me written permission to copy and distribute
these electronic documents by way of email, and I will include this letter of
permission on the CD-ROMs along with the downloaded documents.

Thank you for your time and attention in this matter.



Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
