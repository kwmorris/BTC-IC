Of course you can use the material as you wish. It would be nice to have
 an
acknowledgement, of course, which I am sure you intend to provide. I am of
the opinion that internet material is in the public domain, freely provided
by the author. I really appreciate the wider use of this material. I have a
lot of fun with electronics, and like to share it.

Best wishes,
