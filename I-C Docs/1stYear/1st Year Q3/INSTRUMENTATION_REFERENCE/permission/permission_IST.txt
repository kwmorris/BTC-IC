Hello Jeff,

I just stumbled upon a few chapters of the E-book 
"Hazardous Gas Monitors" on the International 
Sensor Technology website, and am quite impressed 
with the depth and clarity of the information 
presented.  My purpose in emailing you is to obtain 
permission to use this outstanding book for 
teaching my students at Bellingham Technical College 
(Instrumentation and Control Technology program).

Also, I was wondering if the E-book was available 
in a single PDF file rather than one file per chapter.

Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt

Dear Tony,
 
Thank you for your message. Yes, please feel free 
to use whatever you may need in the "Hazardous 
Gas Monitors" book for use in your course.  I'm 
sorry, but we only have the few chapters that are 
on our website in pdf form.  We don't have the 
entire book available in pdf.  But we have plenty 
of the books in stock.  They are available at 
half the cover price of $80.00 - on sale for 
$40.00 each, plus shipping via UPS / Fed-Ex.
 
Best Regards,
