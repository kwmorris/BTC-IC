Hi Tony, 

Thank you for your inquiry and I must say our materials have
become fairly dated though still relevant.  We only maintain 
this website (and things are due to go away fairly soon) for 
customer downloads and software-hardware pairings plus a 
couple of databases we maintain.

The internet presence as you see it today is due to change 
fairly significantly within the next 2-3 months at latest.  
Plus, the assets are pretty old.

With these forewarnings offered, as long as they're not for 
sale and attribution is given to Belden, we are OK with you 
using the materials requested.  I appreciate your direct 
contact on the matter and we always want to support 
education in this field -- so essential to the future.

Thank you again, and if I can remember it, I will provide 
you updates periodically on new/updated materials.

Katherine
