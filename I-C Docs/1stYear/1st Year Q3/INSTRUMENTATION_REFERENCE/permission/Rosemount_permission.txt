Dear Tony Kuphaldt: 

Yes, you have permission to include Rosemount manuals on the CD-ROM that you
plan to provide to your students.  Please note that our legal department
requires that the notice at the bottom of this email message to be included
on any CD that contains Rosemount technical documents. 

I have also asked our literature warehouse to send you the latest copy of
our Manuals CD-ROM.  It will probably be easier to copy the various PDF
files from the CD, rather than downloading all of the files off our website.
You should be receiving this CD within 1-2 weeks. 

Best Regards, 

James Schmidt
Emerson Process Management, Rosemount Division

Subject: Distributing technical manual .pdf's on CD-ROM

To Whom it may concern,

I teach Instrumentation at Bellingham Technical College, and am preparing
curriculum for the 2002-2003 teaching year.  I would like to package many of
your fine technical manual .pdf files onto CD-ROMs for my students, for
their refernce off-line (many do not have internet access at home, and their
homework will include research on several Rosemount products).

In specific, I am referring to the ful-length technical manuals on the
Rosemount 1151 DP, 3055 DP, 3144 Temperature, and other staple industrial
measurement instruments in the Rosemount product line.  

Given the fact that you have freely posted these files on the web, I assume
there will be no problem with copying and distributing them on CD-ROM for my
students.  Please inform me if there is any problem with this.  Your
response, either positive or negative, will be greatly appreciated.


Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
