To Whom it may Concern,

I am an instructor of instrumentation at Bellingham
Technical College in Washington state, and am in 
the process of compiling a reference CD-ROM for my 
students' use.  Having an "offline" reference is 
important for students who do not have fast 
internet service, or internet service at all at 
their homes.  I am interested in copying PDF files 
available for download from your website on to these 
disks.  I am particularly interested in the user's 
and maintenance manuals for the 13A pneumatic DP 
cell, but several other PDF documents on your site 
are of interest to me as well.

Please let me know if this use of your material 
would be permissible.  These CD-ROM disks will 
only be used for students' educational purposes, 
and they will not be sold.  Of course I will give 
proper attribution to you as the author and 
provider of this material on the CD-ROM.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
