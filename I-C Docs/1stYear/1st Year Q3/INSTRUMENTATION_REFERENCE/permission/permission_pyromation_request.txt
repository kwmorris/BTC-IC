To Whom it may Concern,

I am an instructor of instrumentation at Bellingham
Technical College in Washington state, and am in the
process of compiling a reference CD-ROM for my 
students' use.  Having an "offline" reference is 
important for students who do not have fast internet 
service, or internet service at all at their homes.
I am interested in copying some of your technical 
reference PDF files from your website and copying 
them on to these disks, specifically (but not 
limited to) the thermocoulpe and RTD reference 
tables.

Please let me know if this use of your material 
would be permissible.  These CD-ROM disks will only
be used for students' educational purposes, and 
they will not be sold.  Of course I will give 
proper attribution to you as the author and 
provider of this material on the CD-ROM.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
