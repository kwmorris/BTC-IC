                <p>One of the greatest fallacies that exists in so many process

                arises from the process people that the loop needs tuning.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>In most cases the C&amp;I maintenance people send out a
                person who might spend quite long time playing with the tuning
                trying to improve things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He

                </ol>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">This Case History is going to give two examples of
                cases where I have been called in to &#8220;tune the loop&#8221; and
                some simple analysis has shown up severe problems.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The first is a very simple example, and is of a
                temperature control loop in a chemical plant which has always
                had to be run in manual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many
                people have unsuccessfully tried to tune the controllers.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Luckily the control consisted of a cascade system
                with the output of the temperature controller connected to the
                setpoint of a flow controller whose output was connected to the
                control valve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I say
                &#8220;luckily&#8221;, because as pointed out in a recent Case History,
                it is very much easier to analyse valve behaviour if one can
                measure the flow through it.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The open loop flow test on the secondary flow loop is
                shown in Figure 1.<o:p>
                &nbsp;</o:p></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img src="case_history_101_files/Fig_1.jpg" width="742" height="554" border="0"></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><i>Fig. 1</i>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The test shows clearly that automatic control is
                absolutely impossible with this valve when comparing the
                controller&#8217;s output signal and the flow through the
                valve(hence valve position).<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>There is virtually no correlation between the two.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>At times there are huge overshoots on step changes with
                slow return to the correct position.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>On occasion the valve actually moves in the reverse
                direction to that of the change on the controller&#8217;s output
                signal.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">If one had not been able to access the information
                given by the flow test, and if the temperature controller had
                been connected directly to the valve, as so often happens, it
                would have been extremely difficult if not almost impossible, to
                try and find out why one could not achieve control.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">I do find it amazing that the Operators were able
                to run this loop at all taking into account that the valve was
                effectively working virtually completely &#8220;independently&#8221; to
                the controller.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
                also find it even more amazing that this problem had not been
                picked up much sooner, and that people were wasting hours of
                time trying to tune the controller.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The second example is extremely interesting.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>I had been asked to try and tune a controller, the
                purpose of which was to control the furnace pressure of an arc
                furnace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
                normally a very difficult loop to optimise as arc furnace
                pressures tend to jump about quite considerably.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>People often say they are &#8220;unstable&#8221;, which is not a
                correct statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Conditions inside the furnace are very
                non-consistent, which causes the pressure to move around in an
                intermittent fashion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also
                the pressure transmitters are normally calibrated over a very
                small pressure range, typically &#8211;5 to +5 mBar (&#8211;2 to +2 inches water column).<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>This is really tiny, and it amplifies the pressure
                variations over quite a large percentage of the tiny range of
                the transmitter.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">For various good reasons the process specialists
                would like to control these furnaces at a slightly negative
                pressure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many
                people think that the pressure control system should be capable
                of instantly taking care of all the fluctuations.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>This of course is impossible.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The variations occur due to sudden and non-repeatable
                changes internally in the furnace, and it would be impossible
                for any feedback control system to try and catch them.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>In my way of thinking, the changes must be classified as
                &#8220;noise&#8221; which we can define as random fluctuations in the
                process variable signal around a mean level.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The control must be set-up so that it smoothly controls
                the average pressure, but must be fast enough to also catch
                sudden large load changes, which can for example occur if a feed
                does suddenly change drastically.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">In the example under discussion the furnace
                pressure control had been a major problem for many years.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The furnace was tripping regularly mostly due to high
                pressure trips, and a lot of production was being lost, as it
                takes quite a long time to restart the furnace after a trip.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoBodyText">To analyse a loop, the most important
                test is the open loop test, where one makes changes on the
                output of a controller (that is in manual), and try to ascertain
                from the recordings information like valve performance and
                process dynamics.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">In the case of this furnace we tried running this
                test over a period of a day and a half, with very little
                success, as the noise (random changes) in the furnace pressure
                were so large and numerous that it was almost impossible to
                really get any repeatable and reliable information from it.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">When performing this test four signals were
                recorded:<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>

                </ol>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">It was extremely useful to have the last two
                signals which gave quite a bit of useful information.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Firstly comparison of the valve feedback position with PD
                showed that the valve was following the PD extremely well, and
                also moved very quickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
                allayed a worry of the client who had been advised by the
                furnace manufacturer that a possible reason for the poor control
                was that the valve was moving too slowly.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Secondly a comparison of the flow versus PD showed
                that the flow was saturating (reaching a maximum) about half way
                up the range.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
                can be seen in Figure 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
                &nbsp;</o:p></p>

                <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><i>Fig. 2</i>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">If we had not had the valve feedback signal it
                could have meant that the valve was not moving past a certain
                position, and it would have meant conducting tests on the valve
                itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However
                knowing that it was in fact moving well meant looking for a
                reason for the flow saturation elsewhere.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">There could have been several reasons for it.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>One could have been that the extraction fan device which
                sucked the gases out of the furnace could have problems, and
                could not deliver sufficient volume.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Another could be blockage somewhere in the system.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>However the most likely reason was due to the fact that
                the gas was finally passed through water seal tanks before it
                was sent either to a storage tank, or else to stack.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It was felt that the levels in the seal tanks were too
                high and were causing a big back-pressure upstream.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">A test was performed where the levels in the tanks
                were lowered slightly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
                flow of gas immediately increased.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">Unfortunately it is beyond the scope of this
                article to delve too far into the workings of this system, but
                recommendation were made to the client as to proper control of
                the tank levels and to operate the tanks at lower levels, which
                would surely alleviate many of the problems being experienced.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The important lesson to be learnt from the exercise
                though is how important it is to analyse all the information
                available in order to solve problems.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Once again if the flow signal had not been available it
                would have been very difficult and most probably would have
                taken a lot longer to find what was causing the problem.<o:p> &nbsp;
