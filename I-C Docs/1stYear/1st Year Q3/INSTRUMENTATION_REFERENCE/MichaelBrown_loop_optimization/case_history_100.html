                <p class="MsoBodyText">I have been writing these Case Histories
                for many years, and feel I have reached quite a mile-stone by
                writing this hundredth in the series.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>All are based on my experiences in optimising regulatory
                control loops (the &#8220;base control layer&#8221;) in several hundred
                plants in quite a few countries around the world. I have also
                been giving courses on the practical aspects of optimising
                regulatory control loops since 1990, and several thousand people
                have attended these courses over that time.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Some of these people were senior C&amp;I practitioners,
                some with over 30 years experience in the field.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Well over 99% of these attendees came out of the courses
                saying they were the best courses on control they have ever
                attended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Typical
                remarks were &#8220;mind-blowing&#8221;; &#8220;I wish I had attended this
                course 20 years ago&#8221;; &#8220;It&#8217;s the first time I have ever
                really understood feedback control&#8221;;<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>&#8220;I wish they taught control like this at University&#8221;</p><p class="MsoBodyText">I feel it an appropriate point to try and summarise
                what I have found: <o:p>

                    all the delegates who have attended my courses, and nearly
                    all the people that I have worked with in plants had
                    previously very little real understanding of the practical
                    aspects of control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
                    few, mostly with long experience in the control field, have
                    said later that they initially resented me, or coming on my
                    courses, as they knew I would not be able to teach them
                    anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many
                    of them, including some very senior control managers in very
                    big plants have later apologised to me for this, and
                    admitted they had no idea of their lack of knowledge.<o:p>

                    also never met anyone who prior to the course really
                    understood the features, operation, and workings of the PID
                    control block built into his or her control system.<o:p>

                    80% of control systems using PID controllers in PLC&#8217;s are

                    manufacturers of the controllers are not interested in
                    educating their clients in their PID block operation, and in
                    fact most of their staff including trainers and writers of
                    the technical manuals don&#8217;t really understand very much of
                    practical control.<o:p>

                    have stated so many times in the past, at least 85% of all
                    control loops in plants world-wide are operating very
                    inefficiently in automatic, and only a few work reasonably
                    well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
                    entirely due to the lack of understanding of practical
                    control which is not taught elsewhere, and to the complete
                    lack of understanding of the potential huge increase in
                    financial gains if controls work properly.<o:p>

                    very few plants regard optimisation as a separate
                    discipline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
                    is normally only applied if an Operator really starts
                    complaining, or if a Manager realises that a particular
                    control is critical to plant performance.<span style="">&nbsp;
                    </span>In general most plant personnel including senior
                    C&amp;I, and process management have a completely apathetic
                    approach to improving base layer control performance. <o:p>

                  </p></li><li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoBodyText">Optimisation
                    will only succeed if it becomes endorsed plant wide by all
                    disciplines, and if really actively supported and promoted
                    by senior management.<o:p>

                    people, including process experts, and operating staff must
                    work as a team with C&amp;I people of there is any chance
                    for it to succeed.<o:p>

                    needs to be carried out by skilled, well trained,
                    experienced, and intelligent people.<span style="">&nbsp;
                    </span>Many plants believe completely erroneously, that it
                    can be performed by lower level disciplines.<o:p>
                    </o:p>
                    
                </p></li></ol>
                <p class="MsoBodyText">Why am I putting all this down?<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It is not for the purpose of blowing my own trumpet, but
                loop optimisation is my passion.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>I used to own a company supplying control systems, and
                made far more money from that than I can do on my own teaching
                and performing optimisation.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>However years ago due to the help of a special friend in <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>
                
                who taught me the basics of this subject, I fell in love with
                it, and decided to devote my life to it.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoBodyText">However it is very often extremely frustrating with
                the general apathy and sometimes negative attitudes of many
                companies and personnel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
                times I feel like a crusader trying to push the gospel to the
                unbelieving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However
                what makes it all worthwhile and very rewarding are the many
                successes achieved by both people who have embraced the
                teachings and apply them well in their work, and also in the
                practical consulting work I do which in most cases result in
                huge improvements in process and plant performance.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoBodyText">I have an example of this right now.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>I have just spent a week in a process plant that has
                embraced optimisation.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </span>The control manager is committed to improve plant
                performance, and has appointed a team of highly motivated and
                very enthusiastic control specialists.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It is a fairly old plant, and we examined some very
                interesting loops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
                following two examples are taken from<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>those.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoBodyText">The first example is of an important flow control
                which the operators had always been complaining about.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The &#8220;as-found&#8221; closed loop test (not shown here) was
                rather strange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
                appeared that the response to setpoint changes were initially
                extremely slow and then moved quickly at times, and then slowed
                down again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
                also apparent that the valve was sticking badly on reversals.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It was quite a puzzling response.<o:p>

                loop test (see Figure 1) revealed some interesting things.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </span>Basically when the PD (controller output) was below 20%
                the PV (flow signal) was at its lowest value of about 11%.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>(This could indicate that one or more of the following
                problems could exist:<o:p>

                <p class="MsoBodyText">On opening the PD by a further 10% step the flow PV
                also moved up by 10%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However
                another 10% step in PD only resulted in the PV moving in a tiny
                step of about 1.5%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further
                steps in the PD resulted in very little further increase of PV.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>It was completely saturated by the time the PD had
                reached 50%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
                test also reveals at least 5% hysteresis on the valve.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>(This is not marked in the Figure but can be determined
                by the offset in the PV on valve reversals taking process gain
                into account &#8211; see Loop Signature series on hysteresis for
                further information).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

                </p>
                <p class="MsoBodyText">Some serious investigations into the transmitter
                and valve setups, and into the process itself, are obviously
                needed to find out why the flow only can be moved over a tiny
                span of 12% .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
                meantime the control is extremely limited.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </span>If the flow can really only operate over such a small
                range then the transmitter spanning needs to be reduced.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoBodyText">A temporary measure that was put into place in the
                meantime was to put high and low limits on the controller&#8217;s
                output to prevent it moving into regions where it can no longer
                influence the control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
                prevents both mechanical and reset windups, and is very good
                practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
                however tremendous opposition to this from the operators.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>They would not believe that more flow could not be
                obtained by opening the valve past 50%.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>They had the feeling that even if the flow was limited
                then opening the valve further would somehow cause an increase
                in flow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
                sometimes very difficult to overcome perceptions of people not
                trained in loop optimisation.<o:p>

                </p>
                <p class="MsoBodyText">The second example in this article is to show how dramatically good tuning can improve performance.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>I have often stressed that tuning is the last thing one
                should do when optimising.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
                must understand the control system, analyse it and correct
                problems before tuning, and most of my article have been devoted
                to those aspects of optimisation.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>However there is of course no doubt that good tuning is
                also terribly important for optimum loop performance.<o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoBodyText">This example is a very important and critical
                temperature control loop in the plant which has been giving
                quite a lot of problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
                the process is subject to frequent load changes, the operators
                could not run it in automatic as the control was so poor. <o:p>
                </o:p>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The
                control personnel in the plant had the valve replaced as they
                felt that the fault could lie there.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>However automatic control was still very bad, and the
                loop was kept in manual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
                we examined the loop we found that the existing tuning was
                really way out.<o:p>

                </p>
                <p class="MsoBodyText">Figure 2 shows the response of the process to a
                setpoint change with the original tuning. It took some 4 hours
                for the controller to move the temperature up 5%.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span><o:p>

                <p class="MsoBodyText" align="center"><i>Fig. 3</i>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoBodyText">The tests on this loop took just over an hour to
                perform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
                satisfying ourselves that the valve was in fact performing well,
                an open loop test was performed to ascertain the dynamics of the
                process, and to do the tuning.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>Figure 3 shows the result.<span style="">&nbsp;
                </span>The process now takes only 10 minutes to move up the 5%
                to the new setpoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
                is certainly one of the most dramatic improvements in loop
                performance purely due to better tuning that I have seen, and I
                thought that it was worth while sharing it with our readers and
                to finish off the hundredth Case History article.<o:p>
