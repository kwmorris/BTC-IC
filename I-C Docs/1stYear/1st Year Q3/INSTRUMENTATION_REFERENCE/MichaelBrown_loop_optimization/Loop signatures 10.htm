      <P align=justify>A controller responds to input changes with responses 
      dependent on the way the P, the I and the D modules are configured.&nbsp; 
      It is sometimes necessary to perform tests on a controller to ensure it 
      does in fact respond correctly to changes on its input.&nbsp; This is 
      particularly true for controllers in many digital systems, and even more 
      so in the case of many PLC's, where controllers often do not actually 
      respond correctly to input changes.&nbsp; (This may be due to a fault in 
      the controller's software, but more often than not, it is because the user 
      has set-up the controller incorrectly). 
      <P align=justify>A test set-up is shown in Figure 1.&nbsp;

      size=-1>To perform the tests, the controller needs to be disconnected from 
      the loop.&nbsp; The input 4-20 mA. PV signal is fed into the controller 
      from a signal generator. The controller is on local setpoint, and the 
      output (PD) 4-20 mA. signal is fed into a recorder, or the Protuner if you 
      have one.
      <P align=justify>Each test is performed with the controller in 
      automatic.&nbsp; Before starting a test, the controller is switched to 
      manual.&nbsp; The signal generator and the controller's outputs are set to 
      50% (12 mA.).&nbsp; The setpoint is also set to 50%.&nbsp; When the 
      controller is switched to automatic the output should remain running at a 
      constant 50%.&nbsp; The tests can then be started.&nbsp; These will be 
      discussed later in this series as each type of control action is 
discussed.
      <P align=justify><B>Controller PID Algorithms</B>
      <P align=justify>A controller is essentially a mathematical calculating 
      unit.&nbsp; It is important to know which algorithm (equation) it uses in 
      performing its function.&nbsp; Although control academics are always 
      presenting many specialised algorithms to help in dealing with the control 
      of difficult or specific processes, commercial controllers generally 
      employ one of three algorithms.&nbsp; Some manufacturers allow you to 
      choose between two, or even between all three of these.
      <P align=justify>All of these three algorithms essentially perform PID 
      control more or less equally well.&nbsp; However what is not generally 
      known is that different tuning would have to be set in each of them if one 
      was to use P, I and D parameters to control a particular process, and also 
      achieve the identical response from each controller.
      <P align=justify>The basic format of the three algorithms are:

      <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica color=#000000 
      size=-1>Although the names I have used for these algorithms are in fairly 
      common usage, there are as always, no standards, and many of the 
      manufacturers use other, and often confusing nomenclature.&nbsp; The names 
      given here will be used throughout this series to identify a particular 
      algorithm.
      <P align=justify>Historically it is not quite clear how, and by whom the 
      algorithms were developed, but I suspect that the Ideal was the first, as 
      it appeared many years ago in the Transactions of the ISA.&nbsp; Possibly 
      it was formulated by the famous Nichols.&nbsp; Several articles I have 
      read claim that the Ideal algorithm was not in fact suitable for use to 
      manufacture the pneumatic controllers of that era, which they needed to 
      build in modular form. This was because a full 3 term pneumatic PID 
      controller was very expensive, and it was far more cost effective for 
      users to order controllers with only the control terms that were required 
      for the particular application.&nbsp; If at later date they did require an 
      additional term or terms, then they could order a kit of parts, which 
      could be easily added into the controller.&nbsp; It was easier to make 
      such a modular controller by slightly modifying the algorithm.&nbsp; This 
      was the Series algorithm.
      <P align=justify>The Series algorithm effectively became the standard at 
      that time, and with the possible exception of manufacturers of controllers 
      in the electrical power industry, all controllers were made like 
      this.&nbsp; When electronic analogue controllers were developed in the 
      1960's the same algorithm was retained.
      <P align=justify>Digital controller's appeared on the scene in the 
      1980's.&nbsp; The old established instrumentation companies were entering 
      the era of the DCS, and PLC manufacturers who up to that time were only 
      interested in digital ON/OFF control, started expanding their products to 
      include analogue control capabilities.
      <P align=justify>The latter in particular had no little or no experience 
      of feedback control, and their programmers in many instances probably 
      acquired their knowledge from reading textbooks on PID.&nbsp; They found 
      the Series and the Ideal algorithms, and not fully understanding why the 
      mathematicians of old had bothered to multiply the I and D terms by the P 
      gain, they also came up with the Parallel algorithm.&nbsp; This was termed 
      the Independent algorithm by one of the large PLC manufacturers, who 
      loudly proclaimed it as superior, as the I &amp; D terms were not affected 
      by changing the P term.&nbsp; Although this sounds intelligent, it 
      actually shows that the people who invented that algorithm had little 
      practical knowledge of control. The reasons for this opinion of mine will 
      be explained more fully in later articles in this controller series.
      <P align=justify>Initially quite a few of the PLC manufacturers used only 
      the Parallel algorithm in their products, but with the exception of only 
      one, the prominent DCS manufacturers stuck to the Ideal or Series 
      algorithms.&nbsp; However in recent years some of them now also offer it 
      as their default algorithm, or as an alternate.&nbsp; Again in my view, 
      people who programme controllers into computers and who offer the Parallel 
      algorithm as a default, again display that they have very little 
      understanding of practical aspects of control.
      <P align=justify>It is of significance to note that although many of the 
      digital controller manufactures who originally employed the Parallel 
      algorithm, all of them, as far as I am aware, now offer a choice of at 
      least one of the others; mainly because of the unfavourable user reaction 
      to the Parallel.
      <P align=justify>The main problem with it is in the tuning.&nbsp; The 
      Parallel algorithm is generally much harder to tune by trial and error 
      than Series or Ideal.
      <P align=justify>To understand this, one must realise that at least 98% of 
      all loops worldwide are tuned by "trial and error", or if you prefer, 
      playing with the knobs.&nbsp; In general, very few people actually are 
      really capable of achieving good tuning this way, but there are some who 
      have over the years developed a wonderful "touch" for trial and error 
      tuning, and have become extremely proficient in this art.&nbsp; Now this 
      experience has generally been gained on controllers that are equipped with 
      Series or Ideal algorithms.&nbsp; The tuning for both of these is 
      identical for P + I tuning.&nbsp; It only differs for P + I + D 
      tuning.&nbsp; (An inspection of the equations above will explain why this 
      is so, because when D is set to zero the equations become identical).
      <P align=justify>If you were to take one of these highly experienced 
      tuning wizards and ask him (or her) to tune a loop that had a controller 
      with a Parallel algorithm, the result would be catastrophic, as the "feel" 
      that the person had developed using the Series or Ideal algorithm is of no 
      use whatsoever when tuning a Parallel controller.&nbsp; It works 
      completely differently.&nbsp; For example if you had a loop that contained 
      a Series or Ideal controller, and the loop was cycling badly in automatic, 
      you would generally reduce the proportional gain to try and stop the 
      cycle.&nbsp; However if you were to do this on a loop controlled by a 
      Parallel controller, the loop would actually cycle more. 
      <P align=justify>Reasons for the strange behaviour of the Parallel 
      algorithm and why it is so difficult to use, will be given when the I term 
      is described later in this controller series, and also when tuning is 
      covered, which will be much later in the Loop Signature series.</FONT>
