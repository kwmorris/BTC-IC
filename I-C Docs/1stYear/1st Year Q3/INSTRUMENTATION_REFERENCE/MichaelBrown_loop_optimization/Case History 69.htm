      face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica>Some unusual integrating 
      processes</FONT></B>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>As mentioned in 
      previous articles, all industrial processes fall into one of two classes 
      of dynamics, known as self-regulating and integrating.&nbsp; In particular 
      refer to Loop Signature No.2 for a full description of these two 
      classes.&nbsp; As mentioned there, most people have very little 
      understanding and knowledge of integrating processes, and as a result most 
      of these processes which I encounter on plants, are not being controlled 
      well at all.&nbsp; 
      <P>The simplest and most commonly encountered integrating process is level 
      control.&nbsp; Generally all level control systems are integrating, but 
      there is one exception. This is where one is controlling the level in a 
      vessel where the liquid is flowing over a weir.&nbsp; This is similar in 
      nature to measurement of the flow of a liquid in an open channel, where 
      the height of the liquid above the weir bears a direct mathematical 
      relationship to the flow rate.&nbsp; Flow processes are always 
      self-regulating in nature.&nbsp; Therefore in this case the level control 
      is also self-regulating.
      <P>The example given here is the level control of an ingot cooling bath in 
      a stainless steel mill in the U.K.&nbsp; After rolling, the steel ingots 
      passed through a bath to cool them down.&nbsp; The bath consisted of a 
      tank with rectangular slots in the side to allow the passage of the ingot 
      through it.&nbsp; Naturally the water also poured out of the slots, and 
      was continually pumped back up into the bath.
      <P>Figure 1 shows the closed loop "as found" test.&nbsp; It can be seen 
      that the control is terrible. Although the level is fluctuating over a 
      relatively small range the PD (controller output) is more or less 
      fluctuating around very rapidly over a huge range, sometimes as high as 
      95%.&nbsp; As one can imagine the life of the valve was being severely 
      affected.

      <DIV align=center><B>Figure 1</B></DIV>
      <P>The open loop test shown in Figure 2 is very interesting.&nbsp; Firstly 
      it shows the level never drops below 61%.&nbsp; This is because the level 
      cannot physically drop below the bottom of the slots in the side of the 
      bath.&nbsp; One should note that this is a case where the measurement 
      calibration is extremely important, as the process is integrating below 
      the minimum level, and self-regulating once the level rises above the 
      minimum.&nbsp; The tuning for the two conditions would be completely 
      different.&nbsp; However in a&nbsp; case like this one only wants to 
      control above the minimum level where it is self-regulating, and therefore 
      it is very important that the measurement is correct.

      face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>
      <DIV align=center><B>Figure 2</B></DIV>
      <P>The second thing of interest is that the level responds to PD steps in 
      a normal self-regulating way.&nbsp; The third thing of note is that when 
      the PD was reversed when the level was near the top of the range, the 
      level didn't start dropping again until the PD had moved down to 
      50%.&nbsp; The reason for this is that the valve was in fact completely 
      ruined by this stage, and now had a hysteresis of close to 50%.&nbsp; 
      (Maximum acceptable hysteresis is 1% or less).
      <P>Once the valve was replaced, the measurement calibration set up 
      correctly, and the controller tuned properly, extremely good control was 
      achieved with very little valve movement under normal conditions.
      <P>The next example is the control of an ingot soaking pit, also in a 
      steel mill.&nbsp; Ingots are placed in a large pit in the floor, and a 
      huge gas flame heats the ingots to a certain temperature, which is then 
      maintained for a preset time.&nbsp; I normally find this type of loop 
      extremely badly tuned, with very slow response, and often with huge 
      overshoots in getting to setpoint.
      <P>The open loop test on this process is shown in Figure 3.&nbsp; It can 
      be seen that the response is different from a normal integrator because 
      the process responds very quickly at the beginning, but then slows down 
      and eventually carries on rising at a constant ramp rate, as typified in a 
      normal integrating process.&nbsp; This response is often referred to as a 
      "positive lead integrator".

          <TD><IMG id=Picture91 height=409 alt="Figure 3"

      face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>
      <DIV align=center><B>Figure 3</B></DIV>
      <P>In this process the lead is caused by an initial direct heating effect 
      of the flame on the temperature sensing element, and the constant ramp 
      which follows, is due to the actual ambient temperature rising inside the 
      soaking pit, and this is going to continue as long as the flame is 
      on.&nbsp; The reason for this is that the pit effectively is thermally 
      well insulated and the heat loss from it is small in relation to the 
      thermal input from the gas flame.
      <P>Positive lead integrators are very interesting as they require a 
      special tuning technique, which is very different to the tuning method 
      used for normal integrating processes.&nbsp; As a result we find that very 
      few processes of this type are well tuned, and in fact when tuned 
      correctly, the response can literally be improved by a factor of 100 or 
      more.
      <P>Another very common process where one comes across positive lead 
      integrators is in paper machine steam driers, where the back pressure of 
      steam flowing into the drier rolls is controlled.
      <P>Integrating processes can also have negative leads.&nbsp; An example of 
      this is shown in Figure 4.&nbsp; This is an open loop test which was taken 
      at a paper plant on a deaerator control.&nbsp; Negative leads effectively 
      mean that the process initially moves in the "wrong" direction, and then 
      reverses and moves in the expected direction.&nbsp; Possibly the most 
      common examples of negative leads are experienced in the level control of 
      drum boilers.&nbsp; It is sometimes referred to as "the shrink and swell" 
      effect.

      face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>
      <DIV align=center><B>Figure 4</B></DIV>
      <P>The negative lead in cases like these is caused by an upset in the 
      steady state dynamics in the process when a change is made to the input, 
      or the output, of the process.&nbsp; For example, in a boiler drum, which 
      is under pressure, there is a mixture of water, steam, and bubbles.&nbsp; 
      If the feedwater flow is increased, then the water entering the drum - 
      which is of course colder than the water already in the drum, tends to 
      alter the density of the mixture by "popping" bubbles, and the level 
      effectively sinks before recovering and starting to move upwards.
      <P>Unfortunately, a negative lead affects feedback control adversely, as 
      one must detune (i.e. slow down) the controller's response so that it has 
      little effect until the negative bit has passed, and the level starts 
      moving in the right direction.&nbsp; In other words, when performing 
      tuning, one must treat the negative portion as if it was dead-time.&nbsp; 
      This means that you can not have fast control on these processes.
      <P>The last example here illustrates what happens to the control on an 
      integrating loop if one has a valve with hysteresis in it.&nbsp; Figure 5 
      shows an open loop test on a level control.&nbsp; At the start of the test 
      the process is at balance so the level remains constant.&nbsp; The PD 
      (controller output) was stepped up, and the level started rising.&nbsp; 
      The PD was then returned to the balance point.&nbsp; The level should have 
      then gone constant again, but it continued rising at the same rate as 
      before.&nbsp; This means the valve had not moved.&nbsp; In fact it was 
      impossible to bring the level down again until the PD was set to 
      zero.&nbsp; This test shows that the valve was suffering from some severe 
      hysteresis problems.

      <P>Figure 6 shows the loop in automatic.&nbsp; The tuning parameters are 
      not causing the cycling.&nbsp; It is due to the valve hysteresis, and 
      shows how valve hysteresis will cause an integrating process to cycle.
