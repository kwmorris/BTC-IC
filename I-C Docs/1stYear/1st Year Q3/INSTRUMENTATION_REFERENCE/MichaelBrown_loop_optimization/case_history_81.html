                <p><b>GOOD CONTROL REQUIRES OBEDIENT VALVES</b></p>
                <p>A
feedback controller effectively calculates the amount of product that
is required to be fed into the process.&nbsp;If for example the output
(process demand - PD) of the controller is sitting at 50%, the
controller is asking for a flow into the process of 50%.&nbsp;The
process demand signal is fed to the control valve whose effective job
is to "translate" this signal into a physical flow of the amount
required.&nbsp;It stands to reason that the control can only be as good
as the valve is capable of complying with the controller's demand
signal.</p>
                <p>As
has been shown many times in this series of articles, the vast majority
of problems encountered in feedback control loops are caused by
valves.&nbsp;This article shows three interesting examples of severe
control problems caused by valve problems.&nbsp;The examples are taken
from work recently undertaken in a large metal refinery.</p>
                <p>Figure
1 is an "as found" closed loop test performed on an important flow
loop.&nbsp;When the test was started it was seen that the flow was
staying fairly constant, but with a small offset from
setpoint.&nbsp;The output of the controller was hardly moving which
would indicate the integral in the controller was far too slow.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><img id="Picture2" src="case_history_81_files/cashis81Fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" title="Figure 1" vspace="0" width="600" height="431" hspace="0" align="TOP" border="0"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 1</i></p>
                <p>A
10% setpoint change was then made and it can be seen how the flow
overshot slightly and then stabilised below setpoint - again indicating
poor tuning.&nbsp;However about 20 seconds later,&nbsp;the flow
suddenly and most unexpectedly shot up almost instantaneously by about
5%.&nbsp;(The controller then took quite a long time to get it back
down to setpoint).&nbsp;This jump was very strange as there was nothing
in the process that could cause load changes of such a nature.</p>
                <p>The open loop test which was then performed and which is shown in Figure 2 is absolutely amazing.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><img id="Picture3" src="case_history_81_files/cashis81Fig2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" title="Figure 2" vspace="0" width="600" height="432" hspace="0" align="TOP" border="0"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 2</i></p>
                <p>As
seen in the figure, the first two steps upwards are of different size,
which could indicate non-linearity or possibly process
saturation.&nbsp;The valve did not move on the first step in the
reverse direction even though the PD moved by 10%.&nbsp;This would
indicate hysteresis of at least 10%.&nbsp;On the next step the valve
moved in a reasonable fashion.&nbsp;However on the following step it
gave a huge movement with some overshoot.&nbsp;The next step down took
the PD to 40%.&nbsp;However at this point the flow reached zero, which
would indicate that the valve stroking was completely wrong.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The
PD was then reversed again to open the valve.&nbsp;However nothing
occurred until the PD got up to 70%.&nbsp;This would now indicate a
whopping valve hysteresis of 30!&nbsp;Two further steps on the PD were
made on which the valve seemed to move reasonably.&nbsp;However on the
following step the valve suddenly went completely crazy, opening and
shutting.&nbsp;The test was abandoned at this point.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>It
is completely impossible to try and control with a valve like
this.&nbsp;I always find things like this absolutely amazing.&nbsp;How
could plant personnel not be aware that they have a problem valve like
this?&nbsp;How did they manage to control this loop before, even in
manual?&nbsp;I was told that it was an important loop.</p>
                <p>The second example is also a flow loop where the control was supposed to be of critical importance.</p>
                <p>Figure
3 shows the open loop test.&nbsp;It can be seen that on each reversal
the PD had to be moved a great amount to try and get the valve to also
reverse.&nbsp;Analysis of this uncovered a valve hysteresis of over
25%.&nbsp;(A general rule is that a maximum of 1% hysteresis is
acceptable for valve with positioner).</p>
                <p><img id="Picture4" src="case_history_81_files/cashis80Fig_3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" title="Figure 3" vspace="0" width="550" height="409" hspace="0" align="TOP" border="0"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 3</i></p>
                <p>The
test also revealed from an examination of the relative step sizes of
process variable and PD, that the valve was over twice
oversized.&nbsp;(Control variance deteriorates directly proportionally
to the amount a valve is oversized).</p>
                <p>The effect of
hysteresis is that the PD has to move back right through the hysteresis
band before the valve will start moving in the reverse
direction.&nbsp;This results in the control being slowed right down and
leads to increased control variance.&nbsp;With a 25% hysteresis and a
valve that is over twice oversized, one would expect very poor control
out of the loop, and this is exactly what was encountered in the final
and very interesting closed loop test, part of which is illustrated in
Figure 4.&nbsp;Small 5% setpoint changes were made first down and then
up.&nbsp;It can be seen how the flow stayed constant with the valve
"stuck" until the PD has reversed through the 25%.&nbsp;It took 2
minutes, 15 seconds, to reverse the valve on each setpoint change!&nbsp;</p>
                <p><img id="Picture5" src="case_history_81_files/cashis81Fig4.jpg" alt="Figure 4" title="Figure 4" vspace="0" width="600" height="432" hspace="0" align="TOP" border="0"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 4</i></p>
                <p>The third example is of a flow loop that was unstable.&nbsp;Figure 5 shows the closed loop "as found" test.</p>
                <p><img id="Picture6" src="case_history_81_files/cashis81Fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" title="Figure 5" vspace="0" width="600" height="432" hspace="0" align="TOP" border="0"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 5</i></p>
                <p>The
flow looked fine at the start of the test.&nbsp;However as soon as a
setpoint change was made the loop went unstable.&nbsp;People often
enquire as to why it wasn't unstable before the setpoint change was
made.&nbsp;The normal reason for this is that operators in many plants
very frequently, if not even normally, make changes in manual.&nbsp;
They then place the controller in Auto after the change has been
effected, and the process has settled out.&nbsp;The process is then
likely to stay where it is, provided everything is steady, and the loop
may not start cycling until a further setpoint or a load change
occurs.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Once
again how was it that nobody in the plant was aware that an important
control loop like this was operating in this fashion and was quite
likely to go unstable at any moment?</p>
                <p>Figure 6 is
the open loop test on this loop.&nbsp;It shows the very cyclic response
of the valve on each step.&nbsp;Such a response is probably due to a
positioner problem.&nbsp;Modern smart positioners very often contain
their own internal P + D controllers which if not properly tuned can
cause overshoots, or exhibit cycling that can often lead to unstable
loop behaviour as seen here.&nbsp;Unfortunately time did not permit
further investigations to be undertaken at the time these tests were
performed.</p>

                <p><i>Figure 6</i></p>
                <p>I
believe these examples once again illustrate how important it is that
the valve does what the controller wants, if good control is to be
achieved.</p>
