                <p><b>INSTRUMENT ACCURACY DRIFT PROBLEMS WITH AMBIENT TEMPERATURE CHANGES</b></p>
                <p>Eero
Hakkinen, at Skorpion Zinc mine, which is situated in a hot, dry, and
dusty desert region in Namibia recently contacted me about a problem
that they have become aware of, which was that many of their
instrumentation measurements were being affected by changes in ambient
temperature.&nbsp;He sent me a report (see below), of their findings,
and wanted to know if I had previously come across this type of problem
before.</p>
                <p>Measurement
drift in instrumentation is not new.&nbsp;In general, drift is mainly
due to two factors, viz. changes with temperature and changes with
time.&nbsp;The latter used to be a major problem in earlier times,
particularly with early AC magnetic flow meters, which used
electrometer valves for high impedance input to the
amplifiers.&nbsp;These units could have a zero drift of several percent
in a single day, and it was common for instrument mechanicians to have
to recalibrate them at the beginning of each shift.&nbsp;However with
the advent of modern electronics and particularly with "smart"
instrumentation, drift with time is generally not a problem, and
manufacturers generally specify it over a year or more.</p>
                <p>Drift
with temperature change has always been a problem, and may be worse in
some types of instruments than others.&nbsp;In particular, thermocouple
temperature transmitters' accuracies are entirely dependent on a very
stable reference junction temperature compensation set-up, and I have
been aware of many problems with these on certain makes of equipment
over the years.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Manufacturers
generally quote accuracy figures at a certain ambient temperature
(typically 20°C) and then specify an accuracy drift figure with
temperature changes.</p>
                <p>About 15 years ago, one of
South Africa's large petro-chemical refineries had so much trouble with
measurements drifting with ambient temperature changes that they
instituted a special laboratory to test all measuring instruments as to
drift with temperature.&nbsp;I remember in particular that they told me
that out of about 15 makes of two-wire thermocouple temperature
transmitters they tested, only that about one third of them were found
to actually comply with their own manufacturers' temperature drift
specifications.&nbsp;There were also problems with many other types of
measuring instruments, but I cannot remember all the details.&nbsp;I
just wish I had a copy of their reports.</p>
                <p>We have
major problems in certain regions Southern Africa with ambient
temperature variations, particularly with day/night changes.&nbsp;In
many overseas countries they have big summer/winter variations, but not
so bad day/night changes as we do.&nbsp;I remember Eskom once published
an article saying that Matimba Power Station suffered some of the worse
day/night changes of any power station in the world.</p>
                <p>Now
conditions in a desert in Namibia can fluctuate dramatically with
day/night, and summer/winter ambient changes.&nbsp;In the report it
shows that on some days the temperature can vary by as much as 20°C
between day and night.&nbsp;So if the instrumentation does not have
good ambient fluctuation temperature specifications, and can meet those
specifications, then the mine has a serious problem for important
measurements; and generally accurate density and flow measurements are
critical for good mining processing.</p>
                <p>Apparently
the mine has not as yet had positive solutions from the suppliers of
the instrumentation they are having the problems with, and I suggested
that we publish their report in South African Instrumentation and
Control, and ask for feedback from "anyone out there" who may have
experiences similar problems, and if they have managed to find any
solutions.</p>
                <p>I would therefore ask those people, or anyone who would like to comment on this matter to email them to me at <a href="mailto:michael.brown@pixie.co.za">michael.brown@pixie.co.za</a>.&nbsp;Also
if you do not have any objections I would like to publish these
replies.&nbsp;However if you prefer I don't, then please let me know,
and I will only pass them back to the mine.</p>

                <p><b>Report on The Effect of Climatic Conditions on the Accuracy of the Process Instrumentation at a Mine in a Desert in Namibia</b></p>
                <p><i>By Eero Hakkinen, Process Control Manager, Skorpion Mine, Namzinc</i></p>
                <p><b>1. Introduction</b></p>
                <p>The
effect of ambient temperature on instrumentation accuracy, especially
density measurement was investigated with the supplier for the last six
months. Originally the supplier rejected the reports received from us,
which indicated that the huge swing in day-night temperatures is
affecting the accuracy of the density gauge readings. Further tests
were conducted on-site to determine the effect of density calibration
errors in a 24-hour period. These highlighted that the error increased
positively at night and negatively during the daytime.</p>
                <p><b>2. Further Investigation </b></p>
                <p>To
measure ambient temperature was originally problematic as one of the
temperature probes of an off-line leach or neutralization tank was
used. The effect on the density reading error caused by ambient
temperature was noticeable but not very convincing as the probe was not
in direct sunlight. An alternative temperature indicator was found and
compared with the weather station data at the main office complex to
determine the reliability of the measurement (Figure 1).</p>
                <p><img id="Picture12" src="case_history_88_files/cashis88_fig1.gif" alt="cashis88 fig1" title="cashis88 fig1" align="top" border="0" height="401" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="650"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 1 &#8211; Ambient Temperature Monitoring</i></p>
                <p>A
meeting was held with the supplier in November at which time it was
also decided to monitor a density gauge in the field that had a
calibration plate inserted and should produce a relatively consistent
reading. The data from both the temperature probe and density gauge
were trended and it immediately became evident that the reading was
inversely tracking ambient temperature (Figure 2). The density gauge
was covered to block out direct sunlight but had very little effect.
This data was sent to the supplier to examine and to come back with
proposals on how we can rectify the problem.</p>
                <p><img id="Picture13" src="case_history_88_files/cashis88_fig2.gif" alt="cashis88 fig2" title="cashis88 fig2" align="top" border="0" height="402" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="650"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 2 &#8211; Effect of Ambient Temperature on Density</i></p>
                <p>The
density and temperature data was monitored in a Cusum graph and it
became apparent that the relationship to ambient temperature is not
linear (Figure 3). </p>
                <p>Further examination of the
recorder data and weather station data indicated that it is not just
ambient temperature but possibly the effect of direct sunlight, wind
chill factor and heat transfer that affects the density reading. </p>
                <p>In
addition to the effect of ambient temperature on density, the effect on
other field instrumentation was investigated. The reason for the poor
bed mass control of the limestone thickener became evident when the bed
mass pressure indicator reading was trended with ambient temperature
(Figure 4). The pressure data shows a very good correlation with
ambient temperature and is thought to be the main reason for the poor
controller performance.</p>

                <p><i>Figure 4 &#8211; Effect of Ambient Temperature on Bed Pressure Reading</i></p>
                <p>A
varying bed mass indication, if real will eventually affect thickener
torque, as the pressure is a function of solids loading. This
relationship was studied by examining a thickener control, which runs
mostly in automatic at a fixed bed mass set point. The examination
identified that torque changes with constant bed mass control and that
it follows the ambient temperature variation during day and nighttime.
The predicted torque for a given ambient temperature and bed mass value
was regressed to come up with an algorithm which could be used to
determine the effect of these two variables on the thickener torque
(Figure 5).</p>
                <p><img id="Picture16" src="case_history_88_files/cashis88_fig5.gif" alt="cashis88 fig5" title="cashis88 fig5" align="top" border="0" height="402" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="650"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 5 &#8211; Effect of Ambient Temperature on Torque at Constant Bed Mass Control</i></p>
                <p>The
underflow density, which is affected by temperature as previously
determined, was examined to see if it follows the same inverse
relationship with ambient temperature. It is uncertain from the data
examined if the density is directly influenced by ambient temperature
or due to a higher solids loading in the thickener caused by an
incorrect bed pressure reading (Figure 6). </p>

                <p><b>3. Conclusion</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>From
the examination of the effect of ambient temperature it can be
concluded that field instrumentation is effected by the climatic
conditions at the plant.</li>
                    <li>The inaccuracy of
the readings effect the control loops and metallurgical accounting more
during the summer months than in the winter months due to smaller
variations in temperature.</li>
                    <li>The control of bed mass in the thickeners does not control underflow density very effectively.</li>
                    <li>Covering the field instruments with a roof will assist to some extent but will not solve the effect of temperature variation.</li>
                    <li>The density gauge used as reference showed a 5% error due to temperature variations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>4. Recommendations</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Test
a field instrument in a temperature controlled environment to determine
if the reading becomes more reliable. An insulated fiberglass cabin
around a density gauge is proposed which is supplied with cooled
compressed air via a vortex cooler.</li>
                    <li>The control of thickener bed mass must be re-visited to determine if other forms of control will be more appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Change
the control of the thickener to torque control from bed mass control
and compare the performance of another thickener left in bed mass
control.</li>
                    <li>Attempt to compensate for
temperature variations (very risky) by developing correction algorithms
for critical field instrumentation.</li>
                    <li>Involve the suppliers of our instrumentation to assist in solving the problem.</li>
                </ul>
