      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>As shown in the 
      figure, if a setpoint step change was made, an error signal would appear 
      on the output of the subtraction block.&nbsp; Alternatively an identical 
      error signal would occur if the PV changed in a step of equal magnitude, 
      but in the opposite direction.&nbsp; (A change in PV due to an effect in 
      the process not caused by the controller is known as a load change).&nbsp; 
      The step in error would then go through the controller and would be acted 
      on simultaneously by all three (P, I, and D) terms.&nbsp; The resultant 
      response appearing on the output of the controller is shown in the 
      figure.&nbsp; The important point to note here that is with this 
      controller, the response will be the same irrespective of whether the 
      error was caused by a change in setpoint or by a change in load.
      <P>Electronic analogue PID controllers appeared on the market in the 
      1960's.&nbsp; They offered considerable advantages, particularly 
      flexibility, as opposed to the old pneumatic controllers.&nbsp; At that 
      time people were still trying hard to make feedback control systems 
      operate better.&nbsp; Bearing in mind that the vast majority of 
      controllers are used in continuous process plants, the manufacturers 
      realised that in general the type of response as seen in the figure which 
      causes the valve to kick open (or shut as the case may be), would not be 
      desirable in most situations on a working plant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically 
      such plants take a long time to start up and get running optimally in 
      steady state conditions.&nbsp; The last thing process people want on most 
      loops when running in steady state is for a valve to suddenly kick wide 
      open.&nbsp; It could cause a plant trip, or it could initiate large 
      disturbances to processes downstream.
      
      <P>When I begin my courses or give presentations on regulatory control, I 
      normally start off by mentioning that in general I find about 85% of the 
      loops I examine in plants world-wide are completely detuned.&nbsp; Many 
      process engineers will state that they are quite happy with this.&nbsp; I 
      have been told many times by senior process people that they would far 
      rather have their loops detuned than running fast and bumping the plant 
      around. Are they correct or incorrect?&nbsp; The same people will often 
      ask me to tune a critical loop as well as possible as its operation is 
      critical to further process downstream, and then they will add that it 
      must not be tuned so fast that it could cause bumps.&nbsp; So in the same 
      breath they are effectively saying the loop must be tuned fast, and then 
      they are saying it should be tuned slowly.&nbsp; 
      <P>If people want the controllers detuned then why bother having them in 
      the first place? Why are regulatory controls needed at all on continuous 
      process plants? 
      
      <P>A world leading American control engineer answered this question 
      recently in an article where he stated that the purpose of the regulatory 
      controls in a continuous process plant is to minimise variance throughout 
      all stages of production.&nbsp; What he means by this is that when such a 
      plant is running at steady state conditions, the regulatory controls are 
      there to keep all the various processes as close to setpoint as possible 
      under all conditions of change, so that minimum variance is achieved. 

      <p>What changes can occur when plants run at steady state?&nbsp; Firstly 
      load changes can, and often do occur.&nbsp; Such changes are seldom very 
      fast and "steppy", but normally occur quite slowly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Typical 
      examples are ambient temperature changes affecting plant exposed to the 
      outside environment like petro-chemical refineries.&nbsp; Such plants 
      typically often swing quite badly with day-night temperature 
      variations.&nbsp; Slow load changes like this will not cause a big kick on 
      the controller's output if it is tuned fast.&nbsp; However the fast tuning 
      should be able to catch the changes and minimise deviations from set 
point.

<P>The second type of changes that will be encountered on continuous 
      process plants are setpoint changes that operators make whilst optimising 
      the plant.&nbsp; Set-point changes are generally steps.&nbsp; These will 
      result in controller output kicks if full PID control is employed.&nbsp; 
      <P>In most cases in a plant it is not actually necessary to have a fast 
      response to a setpoint change.&nbsp; A slower response is generally quite 
      acceptable.&nbsp; 

      <P>One can summarise the above requirements with two very important 
      premises that state: 

      <P>1. Fast control is required for load changes<BR>2. Slow control is 
      required for set-point changes.

      <P>Please note that these premises are generalised, but they do apply to 
      the vast majority of control loops found in continuous process 
      plants.&nbsp; There are of course some loops that do require a fast 
      response on setpoint changes.&nbsp; Examples would be cascade slave loops, 
      or loops where their setpoints are being set from some higher level 
      control system.
      <P>To achieve the above differences in response, you could of course use 
      ramps on setpoints.&nbsp; However this is seldom done.&nbsp; The 
      controller designers back in the 1960's came up with a better idea.&nbsp; 
      They reconfigured the controller as shown in Figure 2.

      size=-2>Figure 2</FONT></B>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>In this 
      new configuration it can be seen that the D term is now only on the PV 
      signal and is not acted on at all by the error signal.&nbsp; If we have a 
      load change, the D term acts only on the PV signal, whilst the P and I 
      terms act on the error signal, resulting in a full P+I+D response.&nbsp; 
      However on setpoint changes, only P+I acts on the error signal.&nbsp; 
      There is no D response at all until the PV starts moving in response to 
      the change in the PD (controller output signal), and this D contribution 
      to the response is relatively small.
      <P align=left>This configuration virtually became a standard at that 
      time.&nbsp; Nearly every controller manufacturer used it.&nbsp; Even today 
      it is still generally the default configuration on most industrial 
      controllers.&nbsp; 
      <P align=left>This is not a bad thing from the control point of view in 
      most cases.&nbsp; I am personally only aware of one particular type of 
      process where it is really desirable to actually use the D term on a 
      setpoint change.&nbsp; 
      <P align=left>However of dramatically far more importance, and what no 
      one, including most controller manufacturers seem to be aware of, is that 
      this configuration in practice actually prohibits the use of the D term 
      completely, even if you should wish to use it in situations where it would 
      help deal with load changes.&nbsp; This is because this configuration 
      makes it almost impossible to test the tuning of the D term on the 
      controller.
      <P align=left>This because to test tuning one must watch how the 
      controller responds to setpoint changes.&nbsp; You can play with the D 
      "knob" until you are blue in the face, but you will not be able to see the 
      true effect of its action whilst making setpoint changes.&nbsp; The only 
      way to really be able to check it is by inducing step load changes, and 
      this is usually very difficult to do in practice.
      <P align=left>Probably the main reason why the D term is so seldom used, 
      is because most controllers have this configuration as their default, and 
      hence one cannot tune in the D term.&nbsp; I personally would never ever 
      consider purchasing a controller that did not allow me to change back to a 
      full P+I+D response on setpoint change in order to allow me to perform 
      tuning tests.&nbsp; Remember that the D term can be very effective when 
      used in the right processes where it can operate effectively - see earlier 
      loop signature articles dealing with the D term.
      <P align=left>When controllers were written into computers in the 1980's, 
      some manufacturers took the configuration one step further to slow down 
      the response on setpoint changes even more.&nbsp; In many instances, 
      particularly on integrating processes, you can have a large proportional 
      gain in the controller.&nbsp; Thus if there is a high P gain in the 
      controller, setpoint changes can also cause a big kick on the 
      output.&nbsp; To prevent this happening, a new configuration was drawn up, 
      so that the P and the D terms are both removed from the error and 
      effectively put on the PV signal.&nbsp; Such a configuration is shown in 
      Figure 3.&nbsp; (The drawing is purely representational.&nbsp; In reality 
      the operation is performed by the use of a mathematical formula, as you 
      cannot have the P acting directly on the PV signal).

      <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>This 
      controller really does give nice slow response on setpoint changes, but 
      the practical effects of it are even more dramatic.&nbsp; A controller 
      with this configuration cannot be tuned at all!&nbsp; This is because the 
      one term you must get right when tuning is the P term.&nbsp; You can again 
      play around on this controller making setpoint changes and adjusting the P 
      term as much as you like, but you will not get any P response.&nbsp; The 
      only change on the PD will be caused by the integral response.&nbsp; 
      <P align=left>You would think that most people would be aware of this, and 
      that the manufacturers would put a big note in their manuals explaining 
      that this configuration cannot be used when tuning.&nbsp; However in 
      reality I have never seen such a note in a manufacturer's manual. I have 
      been into many plants where there their control system has an integral 
      only response on setpoint change as the default configuration.&nbsp; In 
      nearly every such plant no one was aware of the configuration, and as a 
      result the tuning in these plants was shockingly bad. 
      <P align=left>Apart from terrible control, this lack of understanding has 
      resulted in direct financial loss in at least one plant I 
      visited.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a pharmaceutical manufacturer in the UK who 
      had chosen only P+I action on setpoint response for use on batch 
      reactors.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a case where the D response on setpoint 
      change is essential.&nbsp; It can literally speed up the response on a 
      setpoint change by a factor of four.&nbsp; After testing a setpoint change 
      with a full PID response, and on observing how much faster the process 
      reacted, the Production Manager estimated that they could have increased 
      production though the plant by approximately 14 million Pounds Sterling 
      per annum.&nbsp; Unfortunately the various drug authorities of countries 
      to which the pharmaceutical companies distribute their products, insist 
      that the manufacturing processes be sealed once they have been accepted, 
      and no changes are permitted.&nbsp; 
      <P align=left>It is very difficult and expensive to get changes authorised 
      at later dates.
      <P align=left>This is a very good example why it is so important for users 
      to fully understand how their controllers operate, and what options are 
      available.&nbsp; As said in an earlier loop signature, it is essential 
      that you fully understand your controller if you wish to successfully 
      optimise your plant.
