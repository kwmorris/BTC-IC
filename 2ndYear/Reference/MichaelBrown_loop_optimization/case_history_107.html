                <p><font face="Arial">I have been working in a smelting plant
                where they have severe control problems. To make testing more
                difficult and onerous, nearly all their processes have
                excessively slow dynamics, with many of the loops being
                extremely slow temperature controls.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">As in the case of many
                mining plants, it would appear that the controls and control
                systems were designed and implemented by people who do not
                really have a great deal of understanding of the practicalities
                of control. I believe that many plants are designed with only
                the processes in mind, and with little or no thought initially
                as to how to control them. Once all the designs are done, then
                the controls are put in; sometimes literally as an afterthought.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I know that some large
                mining groups have separate project groups who design new
                plants. It would also appear that often these groups may not
                have all that much knowledge of the actual practical
                implementation and operation of plant controls. Discussing this
                at a recent conference with a group of senior metallurgists and
                control engineers from various mining plants, I was told that
                they find many design errors and faults in new plants, which
                they make note of, and then feedback that information to the
                project design group. However when the next plant is built, they
                find exactly the same problems have been repeated. When they
                complain, they are always fobbed off with some remark like &#8220;it&#8217;s
                a question of economics&#8221;, or &#8220;in our experience it works
                fine.&#8221; All very frustrating for these good people.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">When it comes to the
                controls and control strategies it is obvious that in many cases
                very little thought and knowledge has been employed. Often poor,
                or even unsuitable control equipment is used, probably due to
                ignorance, or based solely on cost rather than on the control
                requirements.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Controls in many mining
                plants also often seem to have been designed by metallurgists.
                Many metallurgists I have met who do not come from a chemical
                engineering background, usually have not undergone control
                courses, and have picked up their control knowledge in the
                field. Although many of these people no doubt are very competent
                and do a great job, I have on occasion come across some rather
                weird and wonderful control strategies that they have concocted.
                Some of these would have even made Heath Robinson quite envious.
                One fairly common example which I have come across several times
                in plants is finding two control valves in series in the same
                line in close proximity to each other, the one being for
                controlling pressure, and the other for controlling the flow.
                This is very interactive and doesn&#8217;t work at all well, usually
                resulting in on of the loops being left permanently in manual.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">An example of a strange
                control strategy in this particular plant, was a control for a
                very important air temperature, which is critical for
                satisfactory operation of a drier further downstream. Instead of
                putting a direct feedback control onto one of the important
                control loops on this temperature, the designer had come up with
                some extremely complicated and highly involved control system
                which involved using a PI controller as a sort of ramp generator
                that continuously tried to get its output up to maximum, but
                actually attempted to achieve the control by writing a
                complicated formula from a calculation block that adjusted the
                high output limit of the controller up and down in an attempt to
                keep the critical temperature operating between two limits.
                Unfortunately when it reached the high limit another control
                came in which rapidly closed down the damper, and caused a huge
                bump in temperature. This is disastrous for the drier control as
                this air temperature needs to be kept as constant as possible.
                The probable reason for this design will be discussed a little
                later.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The interesting thing
                about it is that the people in the plant who have been using
                this system for years have got used to working with it, and didn&#8217;t
                want it changed, even with the bad control. There were remarks
                like: &#8220;We want you to make it work better, but don&#8217;t change
                the way it works&#8221;, and &#8220;Can&#8217;t you tune it better?&#8221;, or
                &#8220;Possibly the damper has problems&#8221;. People are very
                resistant to change, even if you can make it much better by
                implementing a much simpler and better control strategy.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Then there were also
                things in the plant, like using multiple controllers to control
                a single variable, where one would have done the job much
                better.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Another problem we
                unearthed was with a pressure control where three fans are used
                in parallel each with its own up-stream damper to suck gases out
                of a furnace. The idea was that depending on load, one, two, or
                three fans could run. The problem was that the dampers were
                relatively crude flaps sitting in a duct of about 1.5 meter
                diameter. When closed they did not shut off tightly, to say the
                least. This results in the fact that if a fan is off-line with
                its damper shut, then part of the gases being pushed through by
                the working fans are bypassed, and recirculated through the
                non-working fan instead of all going on up the stack. It was
                interesting to see that the fan that was off-line was actually
                being spun backwards. Thus a tremendous amount of energy and
                effort is being wasted. It was not surprising that it was
                extremely difficult trying to get the pressure up to setpoint.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Returning to the air
                temperature control; I was informed by a senior metallurgist
                that it exhibited &#8220;a severe flywheel effect&#8221;. He explained
                that if a change was made it took a long time to for it to take
                effect, and if the change was too large and eventually resulted
                in the process variable overshooting the setpoint, it would take
                a long time before corrective action would take effect. This is
                very much the sort of behaviour you see when changing speed of a
                flywheel with a large mass, which exhibits a high degree of
                inertia.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">&#8220;</font>A severe flywheel
                effect&#8221; is a fairly good way of describing processes with very
                slow dynamics. Essentially one tunes a controller to try and
                match the dynamics of a process as closely as possible. (My Part
                2 Loop Signature series on control of more difficult processes,
                which were published in this magazine over the past couple of
                years, give detailed information on this subject for every type
                of dynamic that one might encounter in industrial process
                control.) The important thing here is that it means that
                processes with slow dynamics can only be controlled with a slow
                tuning, whereas fast processes can have fast control. This makes
                the control of slow processes more difficult from several
                aspects, including making the tuning more difficult because of
                the time it takes, and also from the importance of the need of
                the final control element (e.g. the valve) to do its job exactly
                as dictated by the controller. For example if you have a valve
                that has non-linear installed characteristics, or exhibits
                problems like hysteresis, then the controller has to do extra
                work to also correct for the valve problems, which may take a
                very long time, and result in rotten control.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">In essence the purpose of the system on
                this smelter was to control the temperature of a flow of air
                which is being blown into the drier. The air is heated by
                passing it through a &#8220;hot gas generator&#8221; which utilises a
                fluidised bed. There are quite a few controls loops involved on
                this unit, but the two most important are:</font></p>
                <blockquote>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">a. </font>Temperature
                    of the fluidised bed of the generator, which is controlled
                    by varying the amount of fuel being fed into the generator.</font></p>
                    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><font size="2">b. </font>Outlet
                    temperature of the hot air being heated as it passes though
                    the generator. This is controlled by varying the flow of air
                    coming into the generator through a damper on the input.</font></p>
                  </blockquote>
                </blockquote>
                <p><font face="Arial">Figure 1 shows a sketch of the system, but
                with a more conventional control strategy than was actually
                employed in the plant.</font></p>
                <p align="center"><img src="case_history_107_files/Fig_1.gif" width="515" height="353" border="0"><br>
                <i>Fig 1</i></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">As can be expected these two controls are
                highly interactive. If the output of either controller moved it
                had a severe effect on both of the PV&#8217;s (process variables).</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Both of the temperature processes are very
                complex and interesting from the dynamic point of view. The bed
                temperature is an extremely slow integrating process with a
                large lag on it. Integrating processes are those that can only
                stay constant if one balances the input and output, which in
                this case is heat energy. If the input is larger than the output
                then the temperature will keep rising in a constant ramp, and
                will &#8220;run away&#8221;, and vice versa. (This is very similar to
                control of tank levels, except levels are much faster).
                Integrating processes are hard to control in manual because of
                this and require constant supervision. They really must operate
                in automatic. To illustrate the difficulty of manual control, we
                observed an operator trying for over 3 hours to stabilize this
                loop in manual without success. The slowness of this process
                coupled with the lag make it extremely difficult to control, and
                feedback control will perforce have to operate very slowly for
                stability. This is the loop that behaves with the &#8220;flywheel
                effect&#8221;.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The outlet temperature
                loop on the other hand is basically self-regulating (like a flow
                control) and is very fast relative to the bed temperature. A
                test was performed on it that proved it was extremely easy to
                control well using a conventional PI feedback controller. The
                existing control strategy on this process which was mentioned
                earlier using the &#8220;ramp generator&#8221; is very odd, and no one
                we spoke to could really explain properly how it works and why
                it was designed like that. The most probable reason that it was
                instituted is because there is a huge problem associated with
                this control as it interacts so badly with the bed temperature.
                If a normal control, operating with a medium fast response, was
                to be instituted on the outlet temperature, huge swings on the
                bed temperature result. There is a very tight high limit trip on
                the bed temperature, which makes the situation even more
                difficult. Therefore it becomes necessary that the outlet
                temperature control must operate extremely slowly. I believe the
                original strange control system was an attempt to slow the air
                temperature control down to prevent it causing bumps on the bed
                temperature with its &#8220;horrible flywheel effect&#8221;.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The recommendation was
                made to the plant that they should replace the existing outlet
                temperature control system with a conventional control loop as
                shown in Figure 1. This would, as mentioned above, need to be
                drastically detuned to minimise bumps on the bed temperature.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Another thing that would
                help a great deal would be to employ dynamic decoupling
                (feedforward in both directions) between the two loops. This has
                also been detailed in the Part 2 Loop Signature series.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">These suggestions have been put forward to
                the plant people, but to date no decision on whether to try and
                implement the changes or not have been made. It would be very
                interesting if they agree to go ahead with the modifications,
                but as stated earlier they may prefer to live with the existing
                system which they are familiar with, even though it doesn&#8217;t
                work well. People get used to living with problems, and hate
                changes.</font></p>
