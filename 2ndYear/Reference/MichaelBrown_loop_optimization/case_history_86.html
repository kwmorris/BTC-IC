                <p><b>PROBLEMS IN CONTROLLING THE PRESSURE IN AN ARC FURNACE</b></p>
                <p>Some
interesting problems relating to pressure control were presented to me
recently which concerned the control of pressures in an arc furnace in
a metals plant.</p>
                <p>Figure 1 shows a block diagram
of the process.&nbsp;A large amount of combustible gas is produced
whilst the furnace is operating.&nbsp;The gas is sucked out of the
furnace, and passes though a gas plant where it is cleaned.&nbsp;The
suction&nbsp;is provided by two compressors connected in parallel,
which are situated downstream from the gas plant.&nbsp;A certain amount
of the gas is used as fuel for other processes in the plant, and the
remainder is sent to the stack.</p>
                <p><img id="Picture9" src="case_history_86_files/cashis86_fig_1.jpg" alt="cashis86 fig 1" title="cashis86 fig 1" align="top" border="0" height="333" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="550"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 1</i></p>
                <p>The process people who designed the plant wished to control the gas pressure at two places as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Furnace Pressure Control:<br>It is desirable that the furnace pressure be kept constant.&nbsp;If it gets too high, flames start shooting out 
                        of the furnace through the seals and this can damage them, apart from fumes being expelled. </li>
                    <li>Users' Pressure Control<br>The
pressure of the gas being supplied to the other users should preferably
be kept constant.&nbsp;Also if it exceeds a certain pressure, damage
and other problems can occur in the other processes.&nbsp;A high users
pressure sensor is incorporated in the system to trip the gas plant on
high pressure.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>As
can be seen in Figure 1, the designers attempted to achieve the first
of these two objectives by mounting a recycle valve around the
compressors to vary the suction pressure at the compressor
inlet.&nbsp;It was hoped that adjusting this valve by the furnace
pressure controller would be able to keep the furnace pressure at the
desired control setpoint.</p>
                <p>To
control the users' pressure a control valve was installed before the
stack to control the of the compressors' outlet pressure which feeds to
the users (and of course also to the stack).&nbsp;This was implemented
by measuring the compressor outlet pressure and adjusting the valve via
the users' pressure controller.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately
these control strategies have some fatal flaws in them which prevented
the system from working as was intended, and resulted in large costs in
having to replace the seals on the furnace on a fairly regular
basis.&nbsp;Also gas plant trips occurred frequently due to high user
pressure surges, at the compressors' outlets.</p>
                <p>What
occurred in practice was that very poor control was achieved.&nbsp;One
of the major problems is that the pressure inside the furnace varies
continuously as conditions in an arc furnace are in a continuous state
of flux , and can fluctuate extremely rapidly and frequently.&nbsp;From
time to time, some sort of substantial event occurs inside the furnace
that results in a huge pressure surge for a short while.&nbsp;Such a
surge can be seen in Figure 3, where the furnace pressure suddenly
spiked up and then back down at a time when both controllers were in
manual, with steady outputs.</p>
                <p>The
next problem is that the two control loops are in fact highly
interactive.&nbsp;Looking at the block drawing it appears pretty
obvious that any movement in the furnace pressure control valve must
have an effect simultaneously on the compressors' output as well as on
the suction pressure.&nbsp;So any action taken by the furnace pressure
controller will also immediately effect the compressors' outlet
pressure, which is the users' pressure.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>To give an
example of how this interaction works, let us imagine that conditions
were fairly steady, and the controllers are managing to keep the
pressures more or less at their setpoints.&nbsp;Suddenly there is a
large pressure surge in the furnace.&nbsp;The furnace pressure
controller will immediately start closing the recycle valve to increase
suction.&nbsp;The compressors' outlet pressure, which is the users'
pressure will also then increase immediately.&nbsp;The users' pressure
controller will sense this and will then start opening the vent valve
to drop the in-plant pressure, which in turn will effect the suction
pressure and so-on.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately
feedback control cannot cope well in interactive situations.&nbsp;If
you have two interactive feedback loops, all you can really do to
decouple them (without resorting to more advanced techniques like
dynamic decouplers), is to tune the one fast and the other much
slower.&nbsp;If you really think about it, the ultimate method of
decoupling is to put one loop in manual!</p>
                <p>The
difficulty on this system is that because of the sudden and violent
pressure surges in the furnace, one really needs fast control on the
furnace pressure to try and catch the surges.&nbsp;It is actually
doubtful if feedback control would be fast enough to completely achieve
this, but certainly it could reduce the magnitude of the surges
considerably, and keep a much better average pressure in the
furnace.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>However
if one did tune the furnace pressure controller faster, then as
mentioned above, when a pressure surge occurs in the furnace, the
controller will immediately start closing the recycle valve, which will
increase the suction pressure at the compressors' inlets.&nbsp;However
simultaneously the users' pressure at the compressors' discharge will
also increase.&nbsp;Now if we have tuned the furnace pressure loop
fast, it will be necessary to really slow down the user pressure
controller to try and minimise interaction.&nbsp;Therefore this
controller will be too slow to deal with the increased pressure at the
compressors' outlets which will result the users' pressure increasing
rapidly.&nbsp;Unfortunately the users cannot cope with too high a
pressure, and the high pressure sensor on the users' pressure will trip
the gas plant immediately on such pressure surges.</p>
                <p>An
attempt was in fact made to try and tune the furnace pressure
controller faster but it kept on tripping the system - to the
consternation of the Production people..</p>
                <p>In
order to get a better understanding and feeling of the dynamics in the
system, some tests were performed.&nbsp;Initially both controllers were
placed in manual, and steps in the output of the furnace pressure
controller were made whilst the users' pressure controller's output was
kept constant.&nbsp;After that steps in the output of the users'
pressure controller were made whilst the furnace pressure controller's
output was kept constant.&nbsp;These tests are shown in Figures 2 and 3
respectively.</p>
                <p><img id="Picture10" src="case_history_86_files/cashis86_fig_2.jpg" alt="cashis86 fig 2" title="cashis86 fig 2" align="top" border="0" height="389" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 2</i></p>
                <p><img id="Picture11" src="case_history_86_files/cashis86_fig_3.jpg" alt="cashis86 fig 3" title="cashis86 fig 3" align="top" border="0" height="389" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 3</i></p>
                <p>Two
very interesting things were observed from these tests.&nbsp;Firstly
because the furnace is quite a long way away from the compressors, and
there is quite a large volumetric capacity in the piping and in the gas
plant between the two, it had always been assumed that there would be
quite a bit of deadtime before changes in the furnace pressure control
valve would&nbsp;affect the users' pressure.&nbsp;However the tests
show this is not true and the deadtime is almost zero.&nbsp;The
pressure changes move though the system incredibly quickly, as can be
seen in the figures.&nbsp;Secondly the tests showed just how
interactive the system is in reality.&nbsp;Changes on either of the
controller's outputs had immediate and virtually equal effects on the
users' pressure, and on the furnace pressure.&nbsp;However the furnace
pressure did not always react very positively to these changes, which
is almost definitely due to the rapidly fluctuating conditions
occurring in the furnace.</p>
                <p>In the report to the client the following points were made:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There
was no way in which the current control strategy could be made to work
effectively.&nbsp;No amount of tuning controllers could do anything to
make things better.</li>
                    <li>It was felt that the
system was too interactive for any chance of success even if dynamic
decoupling was to be implemented, which would also be quite an
expensive as the control system was working on old stand-alone
controllers.</li>
                    <li>The
only way that even reasonably good averaging furnace pressure control
could be achieved is by allowing fast tuning of the furnace pressure
controller which would mean much higher pressure conditions would occur
at times at the compressors' outlets.&nbsp;This would mean that some
other strategy would have to be employed to prevent the gas to the
users from reaching a higher pressure.&nbsp;One suggestion was to pass
the users' gas through a surge tank with a pressure control on its
outlet, so that pressure surges could be absorbed in the
tank.&nbsp;This was rejected for various reasons, including expense, as
a huge volume would be required.&nbsp;Another very good suggestion
which seemed to be the best, and which was made by one of the client's
process engineers was to try and use a separate compressor for the
users' gas so as to isolate this gas from the bypass pressure control.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Epilogue</b></p>
                <p>The
client accepted the recommendations.&nbsp;The system was changed so
that the users' gas was supplied from a completely separate compressor,
whilst the furnace pressure control was changed so that the control
valve vented air directly to the stack, and the recycle valve across
the compressor was not used for control.&nbsp;This effectively
decoupled the two pressure controls.</p>
                <p>The
client reports that the new control strategy is working well, and that
outages are down considerably, and replacement of furnace seals reduced
drastically.</p>
