      <P>People often have little realisation as to how badly a faulty valve can 
      affect the performance of the control of the loop.&nbsp; Figure 1 shows 
      the response of a slow temperature control loop to a setpoint 
      change.&nbsp;

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>In the test taken 
      over nearly two hours the loop has not still stopped cycling.&nbsp; It 
      looks like it has been terribly badly tuned.&nbsp; However, at the time of 
      this test it was determined that the control valve suffered from a 
      hysteresis of 6.8%, which is extremely bad (see earlier loop signature 
      articles dealing with hysteresis).
      <P>Figure 2 shows the response of the same loop after the valve had been 
      replaced with a good one.

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>What may be hard to 
      believe is that the tuning has not been changed at all since the previous 
      test.&nbsp; On the setpoint change the process reached the new setpoint 
      and settled out quickly within a few minutes.&nbsp; All the cycling seen 
      in Figure 1 was caused by the integral term in the controller trying to 
      get the poor valve to move to the correct place.
      <P>This is an incredibly good example of why one cannot afford to use bad 
      valves on slow processes.&nbsp; <BR>Figure 3 shows a heat exchanger being 
      controlled by a single temperature controller.&nbsp; The temperature of 
      the process fluid is the input to the controller, and the controller's 
      output is fed directly to the steam valve.

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>This method of 
      control is not an ideal way of controlling any slow process, and is 
      particularly bad in the case of a heat exchanger.&nbsp; There are two 
      reasons for this.&nbsp; Firstly any slow process like this exchanger can 
      only be tuned very slowly, because when tuning self-regulating processes 
      one generally sets the integral term in the controller close to the 
      dominant time constant of the process.&nbsp; This often means integral 
      times of many minutes per repeat.
      <P>With slow settings like this, the controller can only make slow 
      corrections if any load disturbances arise.&nbsp; In the case of the heat 
      exchanger under discussion, the steam is fed from a header that has other 
      take-offs leading from it.&nbsp; This can result in fluctuations of 
      pressure in the header.&nbsp; If for example the header steam pressure 
      suddenly dropped by 3% as steam was suddenly drawn off to another process, 
      the steam flow to the exchanger would be reduced.&nbsp; The controlled 
      temperature would then slowly start to drop.&nbsp; The controller with its 
      slow integral would take a long time to catch and correct this, and large 
      control variance would result.
      <P>Secondly, any valve problems like hysteresis cause havoc in slow 
      control loops with long integral settings, as can be seen in Figure 1, and 
      as discussed in the previous articles.&nbsp; 
      <P>Now what one must realise is that the output of a controller sets the 
      position of the valve stem.&nbsp; If the valve was perfect without 
      hysteresis, had linear installed characteristics, and there was constant 
      pressure conditions in its feed line, then this would result in achieving 
      the correct amount of flow through the valve to satisfy the dictates of 
      the controller.&nbsp; In reality, valves are seldom perfect and there is 
      no guarantee that the stem will move to the position as dictated by the 
      controller (particularly with hysteresis in the valve).&nbsp; Secondly it 
      may not have completely linear installed characteristics, and thirdly if 
      pressure variations in the line can occur (as in this case), then the 
      correct flow of flow through the valve will definitely not be obtained.
      <P>If it were possible to ensure that the correct flow rate did follow the 
      controller's output, as would happen if we had a perfect valve, then the 
      problems would be overcome.&nbsp; So how then can one make a real valve 
      complete with problems into a perfect valve?
      <P>The answer is very simple.&nbsp; One makes use of a technique called 
      cascade control whereby a second controller is used to control the flow of 
      fluid through the valve.&nbsp; (This obviously also involves having to 
      install a flowmeter in the steam line).&nbsp; This new configuration is 
      shown in Figure 4.

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>Flow controllers are 
      tuned with parameters that are lightning fast as compared with those in 
      the temperature controller.&nbsp; The time constant of a flow loop is in 
      the order of 1 or 2 seconds, which is what the integral will be set at in 
      the flow controller.&nbsp; This means that the flow controller is quite 
      capable of correcting for problems like line pressure variations, 
      non-linearity, and hysteresis in the valve relatively quickly.&nbsp; Thus 
      the&nbsp; temperature process will not be affected by these problems as it 
      was prior to installation of the cascade secondary.&nbsp; Even if the flow 
      loop suffers from bad phenomena like stick-slip cycling and hysteresis, 
      the average flow through the valve will probably be more than good enough 
      to keep the temperature on setpoint.
      <P>Terminology used can differ widely.&nbsp; (As mentioned in previous 
      articles there are no standards in control).&nbsp; The temperature loop 
      can be called the primary, master, or outer loop, and the flow loop the 
      secondary, slave, or inner loop respectively.
      <P>Cascade control can really work brilliantly, even as mentioned above, 
      with relatively poor valves.&nbsp; As discussed, it effectively takes the 
      valve problems (as well as variations in pressure in the valve line) out 
      of the equation, and in fact could be said to have made a bad valve into a 
      good one.
      <P>I believe that cascade control is really&nbsp; mandatory for any 
      critical slow control process in a plant.&nbsp; I have often persuaded 
      plants to install cascade systems on important slow loops with absolutely 
      excellent results, and has resulted in vastly improved control performance 
      and decreased variance.
      <P>Cascade systems are typically found in the following combinations:
      <P>Primary...Slave<BR>Temperature...Flow<BR>Temperature...Pressure<BR>Level...Flow<BR>Controller...Valve 
      positioner<BR>Temperature...Temperature
      <P>Sometimes people get very confused about the purpose of cascade 
      control, and I have often heard process operators expressing the opinion 
      that it is stupid having two controllers to control only one valve.&nbsp; 
      Confusion also often reigns when it comes to a level control with a 
      cascaded flow control on the valve.&nbsp; Many plant personnel believe the 
      level controller is there to keep the level constant, and the flow 
      controller is there to keep the flow constant.&nbsp; Unfortunately the 
      second law of control states that you can only control as many variables 
      as you have valves, so it doesn't work that way.&nbsp; I often have quite 
      a job explaining that the only reason for the flow control is to ensure 
      that the valve does its job correctly.&nbsp; In passing I would mention 
      that this combination is particularly effective as level is an integrating 
      process, which is very likely to cycle continuously with any hysteresis in 
      the valve.&nbsp; Control will also be adversely affected with any 
      non-linearity in the valve.&nbsp; Adding the flow loop now takes the valve 
      out of the integrating loop and puts it into a self-regulating loop, which 
      is faster, and subject to far less problems.
      <P>One very important point to remember is that cascade control can only 
      work really well if the secondary process is ideally ten times faster than 
      the primary process.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; The reason is that cascade loops are 
      interactive.&nbsp; If they both have similar response times they will tend 
      to fight each other and could be very cyclic.&nbsp; A general rule of 
      thumb is that if the secondary is less than about six times faster than 
      the primary, then it may be better to dispense with the cascade entirely.
      <P>"The speed" of a process is best judged by the ultimate frequency of 
      that process.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; The ultimate frequency is the frequency 
      at which the loop oscillates when sufficient gain is inserted in the 
      proportional only controller).&nbsp; Another and rougher method of judging 
      speed, is by looking at the response time of the process to a step change 
      on the input.
      <P>In conclusion I would urge people to try using cascade control on slow 
      and important loops where performance is not as good as desired.&nbsp; The 
      results will be very rewarding if the system is set up properly.
