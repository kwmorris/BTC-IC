Betreff: Permission to share reports with students



Hello,

I teach industrial control system maintenance and design, and as a 
part of this curriculum students learn about the Stuxnet virus as 
a prototype of future control system threats.  We are currently 
enhancing the security element of our curriculum, and would like to 
use some of the papers available on your website as case study 
material.  The main paper I would like to share with students is the 
excellent "To Kill A Centrifuge" by Ralph Langner.

Some of our students lack reliable internet access, and so we would 
like permission to download these documents and share them with 
students via flash drive or CD-ROM.  Since these are copyrighted 
documents, we will not do so unless and until your permission is given.
These resources will be given to students freely, and will not be 
used for any commercial purpose.

Thank you in advance for your time and attention.
