Subject: Permission to distribute whitepapers on industrial viruses

Hello,

Symantec has published a number of excellent "whitepaper" documents 
detailing the Stuxnet and DuQu viruses which I would like to assign 
to students as case-study material.  Since not all of my students 
have reliable internet access, I would like to distribute these PDF 
documents in electronic form for their copying and use.  Would it be 
possible to have permission to do so, since these are copyrighted 
works?

The files will not be sold, and will only be used for educational purposes.

Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
