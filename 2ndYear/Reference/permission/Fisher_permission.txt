Hi Deb,

Thank you for replying!  I registered at the www.fisherregulators.com
website as suggested, and order several pieces of literature on control
valve products.

Unfortunately, I am still unclear on whether I am allowed to make CD-ROM
copies of Fisher literature found on the website.  Your email reply didn't
say no, but it didn't exactly say "yes," either.  Is electronic duplication
and distribution of your PDF files to my students acceptable?  In the
interest of keeping on the safe side of copyright law, I need an unambiguous
statement of permission from a Fisher representative.

You mentioned the technical documentation CD-ROM offered by Fisher.  Would
this be the only option I have for providing my students with off-line
electronic documents of Fisher products, or am I allowed to make my own
CD-ROM compilation of Fisher documents found on the website?  Either option
would work for me, but having the freedom to compile a specific set of
documents on CD-ROM would be preferable.

Thank you, once again, for your time and attention in this matter.


Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
