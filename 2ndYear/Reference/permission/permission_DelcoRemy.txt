Subject: Permission to use Delco-Remy 10SI alternator service bulletin

Hello,

I teach industrial Instrumentation and Control at Bellingham
Technical College, and am interested in distributing the 
attached Service Bulletin as reading material for my students 
in a course covering AC generators.  They will be disassembling
a model 10SI alternator as part of this coursework, and the 
attached document is the best guide I've found so far for that.

This, of course, is a copyrighted document and for that reason 
I need your express permission to distribute it electronically 
to students taking this course from me.  Would this be 
permissible?  I would copy it onto USB flash memory and/or email
the document to students.  It would not be sold to them, nor 
bundled with any materials that would be sold.  It would be 
available only to my students and not to the general public.

Thank you for your time and attention.
