Hi Tony,

Thank you for your message.

copyright notices are retained, and appropriate, and customary, authorship
credit is cited.

We are pleased that the documents will be of some academic service to you

> To Whom it may concern,

> I am an instructor of Instrumentation at Bellingham Technical College, and
am in the process of compiling a set of tutorial and product datasheet files
for student reference on CD-ROM.  Some of the literature provided for free
download on your website is of interest to my students, and I would like to
formally request permission to copy and distribute these electronic
documents on CD-ROM media.  In particular, I am interested in downloading
the fourteen Applications Manual chapters for your Protuner software,
because of the control theory information they contain.
>
> The reason for doing this is to provide off-line references for students
to take home and view on their own computers.  Many students lack internet
service, or are restricted to slow dial-up connections, and so cannot
effectively make use of your free technical resources on line.
>
> Please understand that these CD-ROMs will be used strictly for academic
purposes, and will not be used in commercial applications of any sort.  If
this is acceptable to you, please send me written permission to copy and
distribute these electronic documents by way of email, and I will include
this letter of permission on the CD-ROMs along with the downloaded
documents.
