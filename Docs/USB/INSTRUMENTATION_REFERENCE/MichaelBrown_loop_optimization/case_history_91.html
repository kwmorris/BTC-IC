                <p><b><span style="font-size: small; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Control Loop Case History 91</span></b></p>
                <p><b>MAYHEM IN THE MINES</b></p>
                <p>I
have recently been doing some optimisation work on some platinum and
gold mines and associated mineral plants.&nbsp; The state of the
control loops in these plants is pretty bad, with extremely few loops
operating anywhere near what could be termed efficiently when in
automatic.&nbsp; This is of course not really different from most
plants of all other types that I go into. However as mentioned in a
previous article, mines have their own particular problems. They
usually have pretty difficult materials to handle, which are often
extremely abrasive (like slurries), and may have widely varying
consistency like ore being fed to a grinding mill.&nbsp; Slurries also
tend to block pipes and valves if their velocity goes too low, or if
they get too thick. Control equipment also has to often operate in
extremely tough environmental and other difficult conditions. </p>
                <p>As a general rule, good
control dictates the use of good control valves. However high quality
control valves cannot be used in most slurry applications due to the
abrasion.&nbsp; Therefore relatively crude valves like pinch, diaphragm
operated valves, and more recently "Dart" valves are being used. (I
also had a technician on a course last week who has had relatively good
results on slurries with polyurethane coated butterfly valves). </p>
                <p>All these facts make good control more difficult in the mining environments.</p>
                <p>Another
complicating factor is that the control systems used by most mines are
of the PLC/SCADA type, rather than DCS.&nbsp; One of the main reasons
for this (apart from cost) is that that the analogue I/O count on a
mine is small compared with the digital I/O count, and this is powerful
argument for the use of PLC's. In any event, this increases the control
problems.&nbsp; I have found that there are far more control problems
with controllers in "PLC plants" than there are in "DCS plants".&nbsp;
This is due to the fact that the PID control blocks are incorrectly
set-up in about 80% of the plants I visit.&nbsp; Apart from this, PLC's
generally have very limited analogue control capabilities as compared
with DCS's. </p>
                <p>The example that will be
presented later in this article is that of the control of a feed
conveyor which exhibited a rather unusual problem.&nbsp; A feed
conveyor consists of conveyor belt fitted with a weightometer feeding
product at a certain rate to a plant.&nbsp; Most mines have quite a few
of these systems. </p>
                <p>On
a typical mine feed conveyor, the ore is typically fed onto the
conveyor via a vibratory feeder or a belt feeder.&nbsp; (There are also
many other types of feeders). A weightometer (usually mechanical, but
nuclear systems are also used) measures the mass on the belt.&nbsp; The
signal from this is fed to a controller , the output of which goes back
to the feeder.</p>
                <p>In
general, feed conveyor systems are usually terribly badly tuned.&nbsp;
In many mines, I have found them running continually in manual because
the tuning is just too bad for them to operate in automatic. The reason
for this is lack of training on practical control and because there are
specific problems associated with conveyor feeds that one needs to
understand to make the controls work nicely.</p>
                <p>The typical problems (from the control point of view) that are found on these systems are:</p>
                <p><b>1. Noise</b></p>
                <p>The
PV (process variable) signals from weightometers are usually extremely
noisy.&nbsp; In the case of feeds to autogenous mills particularly, the
noise amplitude may exceed 10%, which is largely due to the wide range
of sizes of particles and rocks in the ore on the belt. </p>
                <p>These
noisy PV signals are generally heavily filtered. One of the reasons for
this is to allow operators to read the mass on digital
indicators.&nbsp; Another reason is that modern digital measuring and
control equipment generally incorporate a virtually unlimited filtering
facility.&nbsp; People with little understanding of the effects of
noise and the problems that are introduced by large filters, tend to
over-filter PV signals. This hides the noise and other problems and
makes the control look a lot better.&nbsp; Unfortunately it does not
giving a true reflection of what is going on in the process. A filter
is also a first order lag, and heavy filtering completely distorts the
true process dynamics. </p>
                <p>Noise in fact does not
generally have much deleterious effect on process control unless it is
amplified through the proportional gain amplifier in the controller,
and is then aliased sufficiently to allow the emergence of&nbsp; low
frequency large amplitude components.&nbsp; These may then start the
valve jumping around, which can shorten its life, and if the process is
fast enough to react to the valve movements, control variance will
increase. However this usually only occurs on level controls where
there are normally higher gains in the controller than on most
self-regulating processes, or in cases where the noise frequencies are
extremely slow. In the case of a feed conveyor, the noise is at a
fairly high frequency, and the gain in the controller is usually very
small, so in fact the noise is actually attenuated through the
controller. </p>
                <p>I normally never use a filter
at all in these applications.&nbsp; However the real problem with noise
in control then emerges, and this is with operating personnel, who are
used to seeing very straight lines on trends and steady digital
displays.&nbsp; If they see trends or numbers jumping around, they
immediately think the control has gone unstable.&nbsp; This is one of
my biggest problems. I remove filters from loops, and tune them much
better.&nbsp; People then immediately complain that it was nice and
stable before I came and messed it up.&nbsp; They find it hard to
believe that what they were seeing before was actually not what was
really going on in the process. </p>
                <p><b>2. Deadtime</b></p>
                <p>The
second major problem with the control of feed conveyors is the fact
that very often the weightometers are situated far away for the point
where the ore is fed onto the belt.&nbsp; This may be due to poor
design, but sometimes it is for very good reasons. For example the
feed-point may be at the bottom of an ore silo, and the conveyor then
immediately slopes upwards into the plant. Mechanical weightometers can
not be installed on an inclined belt, so the weightometer has to be
installed at the top of the incline. </p>
                <p>The resulting transport
delay, which is the time taken for the ore to pass from the feed-point
to the weightometer sensing unit, introduces deadtime into the
measurement. As discussed in chapter 4 of my CD "Trouble Shooting and
Loop Tuning", deadtime is the control engineer's enemy as it the
dynamic that introduces phase lag into the loop.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately
deadtime dominant loops are difficult to tune, and very few people
understand how to do this.&nbsp; In spite of claims by sometimes
learned academics to the contrary, in fact it is not that difficult to
tune such processes. &nbsp; However it becomes necessary to slow the
control response down, sometimes quite considerably, to prevent
instability.&nbsp; Once properly tuned, such loops perform reasonably
well, provided load changes do not occur too frequently.&nbsp; (There
are in fact special dead-time controllers available on the market,
often referred too as model predictive controllers. However I have
personally never found these working very well in practice, and have
had much better results with a&nbsp; well tuned PI controller which
does not rely on a model that will probably be changing with differing
process conditions). </p>
                <p>In general and over quite a
few years I have very successfully optimised quite a few conveyor feed
systems previously running continuously in manual, or else very badly
in automatic, without the need for filters, and by ensuring the tuning
was stable.</p>
                <p>The
example given here was of a feed conveyor in a mining plant that
exhibited an unusual problem, or certainly one that I had not
encountered before on this type of process.</p>
                <p>The
recording shown in Figure 1 is that of an open loop (controller in
manual) test on the feeder. The filter had been removed from the
measurement and it is interesting to see the high noise level on the PV
signal (the mass signal).</p>
                <p><img id="Picture2" src="case_history_91_files/cashis91Fig1.jpg" alt="cashis91Fig1" title="cashis91Fig1" align="top" border="0" height="443" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i>Figure 1</i></p>
                <p>Shortly
after the test was started, the PD (controller output) was stepped up
by 10%.&nbsp; There was very little effect on the PV even after waiting
for several minutes. A further 10% step was then made, and after quite
a few seconds deadtime had elapsed, a definite increase was observed in
the PV.&nbsp; The PD was then stepped back down by 10%, and it can be
seen how the PV only responded by a relatively small amount, which was
about half the size of the previous up movement. A further step
downwards resulted in a bigger response again.</p>
                <p>This
type of response where smaller movements of the final control element
occur after a reversal in direction are very typically found on
pneumatically operated valves suffering from hysteresis of which must
has been written in these articles. However I have never seen it before
in conveyor feed systems.&nbsp; In this case it was found that there
was a problem with some hydraulic valve in the feed system, and it was
in fact large hysteresis.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>Hysteresis
in self-regulating loops results in a much slower control response, and
increases control variance considerably, because every time the final
control element needs to be reversed, the controller output has to move
back completely through the hysteresis band, before the element can
start moving again. This in conjunction with the extremely long
dead-time which can also be seen in the figure, really affected the
control very badly. </p>
                <p>Figure 2 shows how one
selects a response to tune a process like this. Firstly obviously the
tuning has to take the deadtime into account and this will require a
very small gain in the proportional term in the controller.&nbsp; Any
good tuning package like the Protuner would automatically take this
into account.</p>
                <p><img id="Picture3" src="case_history_91_files/cashis91Fig2.jpg" alt="cashis91Fig2" title="cashis91Fig2" align="top" border="0" height="443" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"></p>
                <p><i><span style="font-family: Fixedsys,monospace; font-style: normal;"></span>Figure 2</i></p>
                <p>The
other most important thing is to get the correct response to a step
change to use for the tuning, particularly in this case where
hysteresis is involved.&nbsp; The step must be one where the process
gain is the highest, which means that one must ensure the movement in
PV is free of valve hysteresis.&nbsp; Then as the noise level is so
high compared with the movement in PV, it is essential that one draws a
line (or edit) through the noise to get a true representation of the
process response.&nbsp; The edit used in this case is shown in Figure
2.&nbsp; It will be noted that the correct response is a ramp as
opposed to the normal exponential response normally encountered with
most process responses. This is in fact typical of the conveyor feeds.</p>
                <p>Once tuned correctly the control was really vastly improved.  It will be really excellent once the hysteresis is eliminated.</p>
                <p>A further article in this Case History series at a later date will also show some more examples taken from mines.</p>
