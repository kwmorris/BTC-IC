            <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica>The regulatory controls 
            in most plants do not work properly </FONT></B>
            <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>As mentioned 
            many times in previous articles, most people's perceptions are that 
            the basic regulatory controls are operating reasonably well in their 
            plants.&nbsp; Our experience has proved time and time again that in 
            probably well over 95% of all plants the basic regulatory controls 
            are completely inefficient in automatic.&nbsp; Working in various 
            plants over the last few months I have had numerous further examples 
            of this which are worth relating.&nbsp; A few of these are given 
            below:
            <P><B>Case 1: A simple flow loop on a mine</B>
            <P>After looking at several loops on a mine in Namibia, all of which 
            displayed horrific problems, the chief instrumentation technician 
            with relief finally found a flow loop which he believed was really 
            operating well.&nbsp; The loop was a simple flow control.&nbsp; The 
            screen on the SCADA system showed the loop running in automatic with 
            the process variable sitting on top of the setpoint.&nbsp; The 
            process was running under stable conditions with no load variations 
            taking place.&nbsp; It certainly did look good.
            <P>I asked him for the tuning parameters.&nbsp; These were P = 0.95 
            (gain), and I = 20 sec./repeat.&nbsp; 
            <P>These are certainly not good for a flow control, so I asked him 
            to make a 5% step setpoint change.&nbsp; The loop went completely 
            unstable, and the smile was wiped from the technician's face.
            <P>Why did this happen?&nbsp; Why was the loop not cycling 
            previously?
            <P>The answer lies in the fact that as in most plants, the tuning is 
            way out.&nbsp; Loops are mostly completely detuned, but in a few 
            cases like this one, they are tuned unstable.&nbsp; In either case 
            because the tuning is unsatisfactory, the operators make changes in 
            manual, and only put the controller back into automatic when 
            everything has reached steady state.&nbsp; If nothing further 
            disturbs the loop, it stays where it is, looking good, but in 
            actuality being completely incapable of dealing with setpoint or 
            load changes.
            <P><B>Case 2: Problems controlling with overspanned magnetic 
            transmitter.</B>
            <P>A rather important pulp flow loop on a paper machine was 
            investigated.&nbsp; Everyone assumed its operation was 
            satisfactory.&nbsp;&nbsp; An open loop test was performed (see 
            Figure 1).&nbsp; </FONT></P></TD>

            1</FONT></B><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>
            <P>The test revealed the amazing fact that the control was in 
            reality not operating at all. 
            <P>The normal pulp flow required was 70 l/m.&nbsp; As can be seen in 
            Figure 1, once the Protuner analyser was connected to the loop, it 
            was found that this flow was almost at the bottom end of the 
            range.&nbsp; The flowmeter calibration was checked, and it was found 
            that it was set to 0-6,600 l/m.&nbsp; This means that the plant was 
            trying to control the process at only 1% of the measuring 
            range.&nbsp; In general a magnetic flowmeter is only really accurate 
            over a 10:1 turn-down.&nbsp; The readings were really pretty 
            meaningless.
            <P>Figure 1 also reveals that there appears to be a problem with the 
            valve stroking, as the flow only starts once the controller output 
            reaches 50%.
            <P>It was suggested to the client that the magnetic flowmeter be 
            rescaled, and the valve be restroked, before any further 
            optimisation work be undertaken.
            <P><B>Case 3:&nbsp; An important loop everyone was happy with.</B>
            <P>Pulp consistency is a critical factor in paper making.&nbsp; 
            Very, very roughly, it could be described as the density of the 
            pulp, and is controlled by water addition.&nbsp; Good consistency 
            control is most important for good and profitable paper 
            manufacturing.
            <P>Figure 2 shows an open loop test on a pulp consistency loop in a 
            large paper plant.&nbsp; </FONT></P></TD>

            <P>Prior to the test everyone in the plant apparently were not 
            really aware that the loop had a problem.&nbsp; However the process 
            never ran at setpoint.&nbsp; The test showed that there was a major 
            problem in either the measurement or design of the loop.&nbsp; 
            Moving the controller output over 80% resulted in a change of 
            consistency of only 7%!&nbsp; 
            <P>The whole engineering of the process needed investigating.
            <P><B>Case 4: Problems on a pulp flow with oversized valve.</B>
            <P>One of the important processes in paper making is the blending of 
            the various pulps.&nbsp; The flow of each constituent is controlled 
            from a master controller through a ratio cascade system.&nbsp; It is 
            extremely important to control the individual flows accurately and 
            quickly to catch any change, and keep the blend the same under all 
            conditions.
            <P>Figure 3 shows an open loop test on a recycled fibre flow being 
            mixed into the blend.&nbsp; </FONT></P></TD></TR>

            <P>The test shows that there is a very high noise content on the 
            flow and that the response to a step change on the controller output 
            shows a lag of approximately 6 seconds.&nbsp; The noise in fact was 
            being caused by the incorrect use of an older model DC excited 
            magnetic flowmeter which could not cope with the solid contents in 
            pulp flows, and the lag was caused by relatively large damping in 
            the flowmeter, which was inserted in order to try and deal with the 
            noise.&nbsp; In addition, the process gain is 3.5 which indicates 
            the valve is approximately three and a half time oversized.&nbsp; 
            (See our article Loop Signature 3, for definition of process gain, 
            and explanation of problems with oversized valves).
            <P>The converter on the flowmeter was changed out for a new model 
            which could cope with pulp flows.&nbsp; The new open loop test is 
            shown in Figure 4.&nbsp; </FONT></P></TD>

            <P>The signal is now relatively noise free and the response to the 
            flow much quicker.&nbsp; Without the noise it can be seen that the 
            process gain is actually closer to 5.&nbsp; A five times oversized 
            valve is not good for control.
            <P>Figure 5, a closed loop final test, shows the response to step 
            changes is setpoint with good tuning.&nbsp; </FONT></P></TD>

            <P>The test shows that a 3% amplitude slip-stick cycle is taking 
            place.&nbsp; Slip-stick cycles have been described in previous 
            articles, and will also be dealt with again in a future Loop 
            Signature.&nbsp; They occur on approximately 15% of all well tuned 
            fast self-regulating loops.&nbsp; In this case, if the valve had 
            been properly sized, the amplitude of the cycle would have been much 
            smaller, and therefore relatively insignificant.
            <P>Once again prior to these tests, everyone in the plant had been 
            happy with the performance of the loop.
            <P>It is interesting to speculate what improvements in quality, 
            savings in costs, and increase in productivity, could be obtained in 
            plants producing products like paper with critically important 
            processes, if people were really aware of what was happening in 
            their base layer controls and optimised them properly.</FONT>
