      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>To kick off the 
      series and to avoid having to redefine terminology every time an article 
      appears, I will deal with some very basic fundamentals about the feedback 
      loop in this article, and also establish the terminology and names that 
      will be used throughout the series.&nbsp; It is therefore suggested that 
      it would be a good idea to keep this for future reference.
      <P>At the outset it should be noted that there are no universal standards 
      and definitions when it comes to industrial instrumentation and 
      control.&nbsp; The industry has been, and will be largely led by the large 
      manufacturers, who generally use their own terminology and 
      definitions.&nbsp; In fact many of them do publish the definitions of all 
      the terms they use in their specifications.&nbsp; Thus it is really 
      important that users are aware of this as one manufacturer may have a 
      different definition of a common term (such as the term 'accuracy' for 
      example), to another manufacturer.&nbsp; It is really a case of "let the 
      buyer beware".
      <P>You will therefore appreciate that the terms and names that will be 
      used in these articles may, and&nbsp; most probably will not be the same 
      as those that your instrument manufacturer uses, or which you yourself are 
      familiar with.

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>Figure 1 shows a 
      simple feedback control loop.&nbsp; The loop consists of:
      <P>* A measuring device (with associated transmitter that converts the 
      signal to a 4 - 20 mA or digital signal which is suitable for transmission 
      back to the control room).<BR>* A final control element, which is often 
      simply called the "valve", even though in actuality it could be any one of 
      a numerous range of devices including dampers, variable speed drives 
      typically powering pumps, fans or belts, louvers, governors, heating 
      appliances, or actual control valves. Although not shown in the figure, 
      the final control element may, and often does, include a 
      current-to-pneumatic (I/P) converter, and a valve positioner.<BR>* A 
      controller.<BR>* Finally the process itself forms an integral and 
      important component of the loop.
      <P>From the control point of view however, the process consists of 
      everything external to the controller including the measuring device, 
      transmitter, valve, piping etc.&nbsp; This shown in Figure 1 as the 
      "process boundary". 
      <P>The signal from the transmitter to the controller will be referred to 
      as "the process variable"&nbsp; (PV), and the signal from the controller 
      to the final control element as "the process demand" (PD).&nbsp; It should 
      be noted that the PV which is one of the input signals to the controller 
      is representing what is happening on the output of the process, whilst the 
      PD which is the output signal from the controller, represents what is 
      happening on the input to the process.&nbsp; This sometimes confuses 
      people, but it will be clearer if you realise that the controller is 
      effectively in parallel with the process.
      <P>The controller itself in its simplest form has two inputs.&nbsp; One is 
      called "the setpoint" (SP), which is the value at which you would like to 
      control the process, and the other is the PV which is the actual value of 
      the process.&nbsp; The controller's operation will be discussed in detail 
      in a future series of articles.&nbsp; However for the present, it is 
      important to know that as a general rule, the first thing that a 
      controller does is to subtract the one signal from the other (e.g. 
      "SP-PV").&nbsp; This difference will be called "the error".
      <P>If a process is on setpoint, and is stable, and an error then arises, 
      it will be because either the setpoint, or else the PV has changed.&nbsp; 
      The former is referred to as a "setpoint change", and the latter as a 
      "load change".&nbsp; Load changes are normally caused by external changes 
      which affect the process.
      <P>Again in very general terms, in most control loops, the purpose of the 
      controller is to try and keep the error to an absolute minimum.&nbsp; 
      Therefore the best method of being able to determine the effectiveness of 
      the control loop is to calculate the error over a period of time.&nbsp; 
      This will be referred to as "control variance".&nbsp; In reality there are 
      many ways of calculating control variance.&nbsp; For example one could 
      integrate the error over a period of time (say one 8 hour shift).&nbsp; 
      However probably the most commonly used modern method is the use of 
      statistical calculations.&nbsp; The error is sampled at regular intervals 
      (commonly at the controller scan rate).&nbsp; The samples thus obtained 
      are then statistically analysed at longer intervals.&nbsp; The statistical 
      standard deviation gives a good representation of the variance, and is a 
      practice commonly employed in paper manufacture where "2 x Standard 
      Deviation" (commonly referred to as "2 x Sigma"), is used as a measure of 
      the effectiveness of the moisture and basis weight controls on each roll 
      of paper.<BR>When operators make changes in manual, they adjust the PD 
      directly, as can be seen in Figure 2.

            border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>When working in 
      automatic the controller looks at the error signal, and then solves a 
      mathematical equation.&nbsp; The result of the calculation sets the 
      magnitude of the PD signal.&nbsp; The valve then moves to the position as 
      dictated by the PD which adjusts the amount of whatever is going into the 
      process.&nbsp; The process then reacts accordingly, which will in turn 
      change the value of the PV.&nbsp; This changes the error, and the 
      controller will then recalculate the PD and so on.&nbsp; Thus this 
      sequence is effectively going on round and round the loop on a regular 
      basis (depending on how often the controller does its calculation, which 
      on most modern controllers is once a second).

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>As can be seen in 
      Figure 3, if the control system works efficiently, it would obviously be 
      much easier for the operator to set the desired value on the setpoint on 
      the controller, and let the controller perform all the work of getting the 
      PV to the right value and keeping it there, rather than for him (or her), 
      having to have to do it manually.&nbsp; Unfortunately it is a very sad 
      fact of life that due to the almost complete lack of training (and hence 
      understanding), of the field of truly practical control, the vast majority 
      of control loops are set up so badly that operators generally make most 
      changes in manual rather than in automatic.&nbsp; They usually only leave 
      controllers in automatic when the plant is running under steady state 
      conditions, where of course the controllers are generally doing very 
      little.
      <P>Control in automatic is often referred to as "closed loop control", and 
      in manual as "open loop control". 
      <P>It should be noted that to optimise control loops, one must use at the 
      very minimum, a high speed high resolution, multi-channel recorder.&nbsp; 
      A proper loop analyser like the Protuner which is specifically designed 
      for optimisation work makes the task much easier.&nbsp; It should be noted 
      that the "tools" provided on control equipment, like DCS and SCADA 
      systems, are generally completely inadequate for optimisation, 
      particularly for fast processes.
      <P>The recorder or analyser, is connected to the process across the 
      controller's input and output (PV and PD signals).&nbsp; Most tests are 
      performed by making changes on the controller either in automatic (closed 
      loop tests), or in manual (open loop tests).
      <P>The next article will deal with the two "classes of processes" which is 
      essential to an understanding of practical process control.
