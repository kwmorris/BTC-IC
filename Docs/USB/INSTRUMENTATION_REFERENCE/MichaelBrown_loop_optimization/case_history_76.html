                                </b></p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Preface<br></b>This
article has recently been published in a leading magazine serving the
Pulp and Paper Industry.&nbsp; However I think many of the regular
readers of my articles will find it interesting<b>.</b></p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Very
few people are aware of the most amazing fact that the vast majority of
the regulatory&nbsp;(base layer) controls are not operating properly in
virtually every plant world-wide.&nbsp;Based on the author's and his
colleagues experiences in literally hundreds of plants in seven
countries, typical figures are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li style="text-align: left;"><b>85% of loops are completely inefficient in automatic.</b></li>
                                <li style="text-align: left;"><b>Approximately 50 &#8211; 60% of the loops have major problems within them.</b></li>
                                <li style="text-align: left;"><b>Less than 5% of loops operate reasonably.</b></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">The
reasons behind these facts are complex and manifold, but the main
reason is that regulatory control is based on highly mathematical
theory which is almost impossible to apply in real life.&nbsp;On
entering the field, most control practitioners immediately find they
cannot use the theory they were taught, and they then start "trying to
fly by the seat of their pants".&nbsp;In general they have very little
understanding of what they are doing.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Courses
that teach the true practicalities of process control have only
recently been available. These impart a really true understanding of
the subject, and even people with years in the field have found these
courses an absolute eye-opener.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Why
is it important to get controls working properly?&nbsp;The answer to
this is because the purpose of the controls is to try and keep the
processes throughout every stage of production at values set by process
and production specialists in accordance with a carefully designed
manufacturing strategy, or alternatively they are set by advanced
control systems like those typically found on paper machine
basis-weight and moisture control systems.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">The
financial implications to the profitability of the production processes
can be huge if the processes do not stay at those setpoints with
minimal variance.&nbsp;Typically a study in a large USA pulp and paper
company recently showed that the estimated annual loss of profit in a
300 control loop plant would be typically US $350,000, based on only
35% of the loops not working well.&nbsp;If 85% of the loops are not
working properly which is what we find in nearly every plant we go
into, this figure becomes enormous.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately
due to the lack of training on practical control, and with a general
acceptance of existing control performance which goes back over many
decades, even experienced control engineers and technicians are not
aware of just how badly the controls are performing, and what huge
amounts of profit are being lost.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Many
people find it extremely hard to believe their plant controls are not
performing properly, and question our findings.&nbsp;They reason that
if the controls are so bad, how is that they are making product?&nbsp;</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">The
answer to this is that in reality most plants manage to operate and
produce product entirely due to operator intervention.&nbsp;When a
plant is running under steady state conditions (which most plants do
for most of the time), then operators tend to put the controls into
automatic, and everything looks good with processes on
setpoint.&nbsp;It must be realised however, that under steady state
conditions very few changes occur in the process.&nbsp;However if a
load change does occur, or if the operator wishes to move the setpoint,
then what happens in nearly every plant is that the operator switches
the loop to manual to deal with the changes, and only puts it back into
automatic after the process reaches stability again.&nbsp;The reason
for this on most loops is that the controls are performing so badly
that they cannot deal with the changes adequately in automatic.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">To illustrate the performance of controls in two pulp and paper plants which the author has worked on during the past two years:</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Plant No. 1</b></p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b><u></u></b>35
of the most important loops on a recently reconditioned paper machine
were audited.&nbsp;These had been previously "optimised" by an overseas
consultant from the vendor of the DCS control system.&nbsp;(The reason
the word "optimised" has been put in inverted commas will become clear
when you read the findings below).</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Findings:</i></p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">1.
The most staggering finding was that a special factor was set as
default in the DCS so that all loops were set to respond to setpoint
changes extremely slowly without bumping the process.&nbsp;No one was
aware of this.&nbsp;Although this can be desirable in certain
instances, it can have major impacts on the control. For example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li style="text-align: left;">(a)
In cases where fast responses are required on setpoint changes (e.g.
grade changes), the Operators have to make the changes in manual as the
controls cannot respond quickly enough. </li>
                                <li style="text-align: left;">(b)
Even more amazing is the fact that normal tuning is not possible, as
any type of tuning can only be tested by observing the process reaction
to setpoint changes.&nbsp;Even tuning performed using their automatic
tuning package (which didn't appear to be very good) requires checking
by making setpoint changes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">2.
There were oversized filters on all flow loops (both on the transmitter
and on the AI cards).&nbsp;Filtering masks things that are happening in
the process and can also lead to other problems.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">3. 17 loops had valve problems (some really major, like completely unstable positioners).</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">4. 1 loop was in a continuous cycle.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">5. 1 loop could only get to 30% of the process range with the valve fully open and could never get to setpoint.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">6.
There were 2 systems in the machine, each consisting of several loops
which had poor, and largely unworkable process and control strategies.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">7. Only 3 loops in all 35, had reasonable tuning.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Plant No. 2</b></p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b><u></u></b>This
large plant has quite a few paper machines.&nbsp;The audit work was
done on 95 loops on various machines and processes, selected on a more
or less "ad-hoc" basis by process experts.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Findings were:</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">1. The existing control on 89 of the loops was unacceptable.&nbsp;That is only 6 loops were operating reasonably well!</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">2.
7 loops had such serious problems that no optimisation could be
performed on them at all.&nbsp;Major reworks will be needed to be done
first.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">3. 20% of the loops needed control strategy changes to enable good control to be obtained.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">4. Roughly half the loops had unacceptable valve problems.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">5. 18% of the loops had problems on the measurement side, including heavy over-filtering.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">6. 3 loops were cycling continuously in automatic, and were running in manual all the time.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">These
types of findings are, as mentioned earlier, typical of the average
plant where control audits are performed for the first
time.&nbsp;Normally before an audit is performed, no one in the plants
are aware of the state of things, and again as mentioned earlier, the
control people generally believe there are very few problems and that
the plant is running well.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">If
controls are running so badly, it needs little imagination to
"guesstimate" what enormous benefits both financially and quality-wise
could be gained if the controls were improved so that at least over 90
- 95% of the loops were operating really well.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">The
only way that this can be achieved is for plant personnel to accept
that optimisation must be recognised and instituted as a separate
discipline in the plant.&nbsp;It must have full top and middle
management backing, for without this any optimisation effort is doomed
to failure.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Optimisation
must also be a joint cooperative effort between the instrumentation and
control people, process people, and operators.&nbsp;Again it can only
succeed if all these disciplines work together.&nbsp;This means that
all people must have some understanding of practical control if they
are to succeed in this task.&nbsp;Courses of various levels are
available for this purpose.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Alternatively optimisation can be undertaken by <i>knowledgeable</i> outside consultants.&nbsp;However they must work alongside, and receive full cooperation from the plant personnel.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Once
optimisation of a plant has been completed, a very useful tool is now
available on the market.&nbsp;This is a continuous loop performance
monitoring package, which can immediately pick up any performance
degradation in any control loop, and can email or SMS a warning to a
responsible person.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">A few examples taken from the work done in the two paper mills listed above are given:</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">The
first example is taken from the moisture control on one of the drier
sections on a paper machine.&nbsp;Steam is injected into the rolls and
controlled at a particular pressure. The setpoint comes from the
advanced control system which is trying to ensure that exactly the
right amount of moisture is left in the paper.&nbsp;This setpoint is
more or less continuously ramping up and down.&nbsp;It is extremely
important that the steam pressure follows the setpoint as closely as
possible, as poor paper moisture control does have a negative effect on
profitability.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">Figure
1 is a recording of the control over a period of 1 hour showing the
setpoint and the pressure signal with the control existing before the
audit.&nbsp;It can be seen that the pressure is seldom at setpoint and
the control variance is very bad.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;">

                            <p style="text-align: left;">Figure
2 shows the same control after optimisation.&nbsp;The pressure is
following setpoint so closely that virtually no variance can be
seen.&nbsp;The control is now operating about 2,000 times
faster.&nbsp;Imagine what potential profits the plant has lost over the
years with the previous poor control!&nbsp;(Incidentally it is normal
for us to find all the moisture controls on a paper machine
detuned,&nbsp;as this particular type of process has very strange
dynamics, which requires special tuning).</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left;">Figure
3 shows a test on an important steam differential pressure which is
part of the control systems on a drier section.&nbsp;At the beginning
of the test the loop was in automatic, and it can be seen that the
process is in a continuous cycle.&nbsp;The controller was then put into
manual and some step changes were made on the output of the
controller.&nbsp;It can be seen from the pressure process signal in
this test that the valve is sticking, and the controller output has to
move through 6% before the valve actually moves.&nbsp;Once it moves it
overshoots by over 100%.&nbsp;Sometimes it sticks at the new position,
but at other times it comes swinging wildly back.&nbsp;On one occasion
it actually cycles twice before settling out.&nbsp;It is obviously
impossible to control with a valve like this.&nbsp; The question is how
was it possible for nobody to be aware of this problem before this
audit was performed?&nbsp; Especially on an important control like
this.&nbsp;It certainly gives a powerfully convincing motivation for
the need to have a continuous loop performance monitor
installed.&nbsp;Such a device would immediately give warning of such a
problem.</p>

conclusion it would appear obvious that plants are currently loosing
huge amounts of potential profits mainly through complete ignorance and

behaving.</p>
