      Case History 55</FONT>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica>Control: perceptions versus 
      reality</FONT></B>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>When starting 
      in-plant control courses I always ask the class members to give me their 
      individual estimates as to how many of their loops they believe to be 
      operating satisfactorily in automatic.&nbsp; In a recent series of courses 
      given to 12 of the control technicians and engineers in a large continuous 
      processing plant, the estimates ranged from 50 to 75%.&nbsp; The nature of 
      the processes in that type of plant demand good control if really top 
      product quality, and economy in production is to be optimally 
      achieved.&nbsp; Literally millions of Rands annually can be saved by 
      keeping certain parameters within tight limits.
      <P>After completing the classroom training, the class went into the plant 
      for a week to apply their new learning on live loops.&nbsp; During this 
      period 25 loops were examined and optimised where possible.&nbsp; The 
      findings were an absolute eye opener to the delegates and plant 
management.
      <P>The following extracts are taken from the final report sent to plant 
      management:
      <P>The exercise highlighted the following:
      <P>* Every control loop examined was so badly detuned that there is no 
      ways they could follow load changes satisfactorily.
      <P>* Changes to setpoints such as on start-ups could not be performed 
      satisfactorily in Auto due to the tuning, and also due to the fact that 
      the wrong parameter was set in those controllers where Operators need to 
      make setpoint changes, so the controllers could&nbsp; only respond slowly 
      with integral only action.
      <P>* On two of the most critical controls in the plant, the ability to 
      follow setpoint changes as dictated from the advanced control systems, 
      without variance, can lead to huge improvements and savings.&nbsp; This 
      was impossible with the original state of the controls.
      <P>* The analysis uncovered major equipment problems in many loops, which 
      were unknown to operating staff.&nbsp; The control strategy was also 
      changed in several loops to improve performance.
      <P>In general the loops that were optimised are now responding to changes, 
      probably between 20 and 200 times faster.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <P>Recommendations to improve the control status in the plant are:
      <P>a) Optimisation needs to be recognised as a separate and continuous 
      discipline in the plant.&nbsp; It needs support from all disciplines 
      including management at all levels, process specialists, operations, and 
      of course the instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) people.&nbsp; An 
      optimisation programme without such co-operation and management support is 
      doomed to failure.
      <P>b) An optimisation team needs to be appointed.&nbsp; Although primarily 
      probably two I&amp;C people can perform the work, they should work in 
      conjunction with a process specialist and a production staff-member.&nbsp; 
      These latter people will not only help decide on control, and process 
      strategies, but can ensure co-operation of the other departments in the 
      optimisation exercise.&nbsp; Our experience is that when an optimisation 
      programme is undertaken, the plant starts performing so differently, that 
      many people actually start resisting, as they do not understand what is 
      happening.&nbsp; A short 1 day course on practical control is also 
      recommended for process people and operators.
      <P>c) Not only the I&amp;C people, but all the people on the team need 
      training, so they can fully understand the procedures.
      <P>d) Proper optimisation test and tuning equipment will be needed.
      <P>In general if optimisation is carried out properly, then the following 
      benefits would be obtained:
      <P>* Increased production.
      <P>* Increased efficiency or productivity.
      <P>* Increased quality.
      <P>* Less reject product.
      <P>* Less dependence on Operator intervention.
      <P>* Far less control variance, meaning that load changes would have far 
      less effects on quality.
      <P>* Ability to set and maintain tighter critical control parameters.
      <P>* Vastly decreased wasted time during start ups, and grade changes.
      <P>* Savings in materials and utilities.
      <P>Apart from the above remarks, findings included:
      <P>1. Many valves exhibited severe hysteresis, sometimes larger than 10%.
      <P>2. Slip stick cycling was discovered on some valves which introduced 
      undesirable low frequency cycling into interactive processes.
      <P>3. Control personnel lacked understanding of correct strategies for 
      tuning level control systems.&nbsp; (As discussed in previous articles, 
      tight level control is sometimes desirable, which dictates higher gains in 
      the controllers, and resultant larger movements in valves responding to 
      changes, and in other cases level controllers must not react quickly, and 
      are in fact only needed to keep the level between certain high and low 
      limits).
      <P>4. Many levels were continuously cycling due to poor tuning, and in one 
      case due to interaction from another cyclic level.
      <P>5. Some extremely oversized valves were encountered, resulting in 
      valves operating very close to seat under normal control conditions, which 
      is undesirable.&nbsp; Oversized valves also contribute to poor control 
      variance as a direct product of the number of times they are oversized.
      <P>6. Huge process variable filters of over half a minute were encountered 
      on certain flow transmitters, apparently to mask problems in the 
      transmitters.
      <P>7. Many valves required to operate over wide ranges had non-linear 
      installed characteristics.
      <P>8. Incorrect calibrations were found on some transmitters.
      <P>9. On certain loops, the controller outputs were restrained by ramps 
      from responding properly to control changes.&nbsp; This type of strategy 
      affects PID control very badly.
      <P>Just to give a couple of examples of "before and after" performances:
      <P>Figure 1 illustrates a tank level responding to a 10% load change as 
      originally found, and Figure 2 the response after optimisation.&nbsp; 
      Figures 3 and 4 illustrate before and after optimisation responses to 
      setpoint changes on a typical flow loop.

      <P><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>It is interesting to 
      note that the plant is not new, and is in fact many years old.&nbsp; How 
      is it possible that a plant wherein control is so important could have 
      been running for all these years without anyone being aware of the 
      problems and the true state of the controls?&nbsp; Sadly however, as has 
      been stressed repeatedly in these articles, this is the normal state of 
      affairs in most plants around the world, and it is entirely due to the 
      fact that there is almost a complete dearth of knowledge on practical 
      control.&nbsp; Many senior control engineers refuse to believe that there 
      are any problems in the so called "base control layer" in their plants, 
      and spend their lives trying to institute high level control systems which 
      can never work as well as they might, as these higher level controls do in 
      fact set the setpoints of the base layer controllers.&nbsp; I have been 
      told repeatedly by some of these engineers that tuning PID controllers is 
      a simple matter, suitable for lower level skills.&nbsp; In fact, in the 
      particular plant under discussion in this article, the previous control 
      engineer had emphatically told me that there were no problems in the plant 
      and that everything was well tuned and running well.
      <P>It does appear unbelievable that situations like this exist and are in 
      fact pretty much the "norm", and it is often very frustrating trying to 
      convince management in plants that they could dramatically improve their 
      controls.&nbsp; However optimisation is not easy, and as mentioned above 
      requires a lot of work and commitment from all parties.&nbsp; Tuning by 
      itself is not the answer.&nbsp; Optimisation requires much analytical work 
      and effort before tuning can be effective.&nbsp; Most people are convinced 
      that the "magic tuning package" exists somewhere, and are prepared often 
      to spend small fortunes on purchasing expensive continuous on-line tuning 
      packages that control vendors are only too delighted to sell.&nbsp; 
      However I have still to find a single plant where the user is happy with 
      them.
