                <p><b>CONVEYOR START-UP PROBLEMS</b></p>
                <p>I
was recently in a plant which is having problems with controlling the
start-up of several large conveyors each of which are driven by several
large motors. I was asked for advice, and the following is taken from
my report to the client.</p>
                <p><b>Description of Control Systems</b></p>
                <p>(Refer to Figure 1)</p>
                <p><img id="Picture2" src="case_history_89_files/cashis89fig1.jpg" alt="cashis89fig1" title="cashis89fig1" align="top" border="0" height="542" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="750"></p>
                <p>The
control system on each conveyor was designed to facilitate the start-up
of a conveyor without causing excessive stress and overheating on the
drive motors.&nbsp; Each conveyor has three or four drive motors, some
of them being in pairs which are hard-coupled by a drive shaft; the
motors in a pair being on either side of the conveyor.&nbsp; A fluid
coupling connects each motor to the conveyor drive roller, its purpose
being to allow the motor to take up the load at a relatively slow ramp
rate.</p>
                <p>The
fluid couplings are the type which effectively consist of two
concentric cylinders, the one driving the other at a speed which is
dependent on the amount of oil between the cylinders.&nbsp; "Scoops" or
vanes (as I will call them hereafter), which are positioned by a vane
guide arm, regulate the flow of oil into the space between the
cylinders. </p>
                <p>The
vane guide arm is positioned by an actuator which is a reversible
electric motor driven by pulses in the one direction or the other.</p>
                <p>A
controller block in a well known make of PLC has been specially
designed to drive normal electric actuators was used for the
control.&nbsp; The PV input to the controller is motor power in
KW.&nbsp; The setpoint input is from a ramped programme written in the
PLC. The outputs from the control block are directly in "raise" or
"lower" pulse trains.</p>
                <p>There
is no position feedback signal of vane arm position, and there are no
end-limit switches to stop the drive at when the arm reaches its end
positions.</p>
                <p>The client was having many problems
with this control system, and it seemed to need retuning very often.
There were many complaints about it from operational staff.</p>
                <p><b>Problems Encountered with Existing Set-up</b></p>
                <p><i>1.  Fluid Coupling Problems</i></p>
                <p>Probably
the worst problems are with the set-up of the fluidic coupling. The
purpose of any final control element (FCE) is to "translate" what the
controller wants into the actual physical input into the process, which
in this case is power. If it cannot do what the controller asks it,
then the controller has to try and correct for its shortcomings, as
well as to try and control the actual process.&nbsp; Unfortunately the
controller is tuned for the dynamics of the actual process, and it
cannot handle the problems encountered with the FCE very well, which
will make the control poor.</p>
                <p>Fluidic
couplings are notorious for problems which include, hysteresis,
deadband, and non-repeatability, particularly if the oil level in them
is not kept constant.&nbsp; The latter in particular is very important,
as it means that the dynamics of the coupling change with differing oil
levels.&nbsp; It must be noted that the controller which controls the
position of the vanes in the coupling can only normally be tuned for
one particular set of dynamics of the coupling. If these change one has
to retune the controller.</p>
                <p>Apparently
various people, including some not in the automation and control
department, are frequently working on the couplings, refilling oil, and
readjusting the vane mechanical limits. This is unacceptable for good
control. </p>
                <p>Another major problem is that
the vane lever position is not measured, so that the controller cannot
know its true exact position - see also below.&nbsp; There are also no
limit switches on the vane lever to stop its drive motor from trying to
move it out of limits.</p>
                <p>Another
bad problem in the control of the power is that the vanes only start
taking effect and allow the motor to start putting power into the drive
when the vanes have moved considerably from the bottom limit -
apparently as much as 80% on some units. The result of this is that
there is a considerable period of deadtime when starting the drives and
ramping up the power setpoint, before the vanes start taking effect.</p>
                <p>A final problem is that it appears that the relationship between vane position and power is probably very non-linear.</p>
                <p><i>2.  Motors with Differing Characteristics</i></p>
                <p>It
appears that in some instances different drive motors are used on the
same conveyor, even with different power ratings. This is definitely
not good practice.&nbsp; Ideally motor characteristics should be
matched as closely as possible for all motors on a particular conveyor.
They need this to share the load as equally as possible.</p>
                <p><i>3.  Controller Problems</i></p>
                <p>The
PLC control block which was used, and as mentioned earlier, has been
specially written for control systems like this with pulse
outputs.&nbsp; Unfortunately there are some severe drawbacks in this
block particularly when there is no actuator position feedback signal,
which makes scientific tuning almost impossible.&nbsp; The PLC
manufacturer themselves in the manual state that the control is
"approximate" as the controller has to "simulate" the actuator
position.&nbsp; The manual on this controller is also impossible to
understand. Even some of the parameters are given in a foreign
language.&nbsp; It is very unlikely that anyone apart from experts in
the company manufacturing the PLC, which is overseas, would really be
able to fully understand this controller.&nbsp; A lot of the features
in the controller are blocked from user input and one cannot make
adjustments.</p>
                <p><b>Recommendations</b></p>
                <p><i>1. Fluid Coupling</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A
special procedure needs implementation to ensure couplings are set-up
properly, filled with the correct amount of oil, and vane movement
calibrated properly.&nbsp; The responsibility for this should be
clearly defined and assigned to a group of people who have a good
understanding of the control requirements. Nobody else should be
allowed to touch these units. No readjustments should ever be allowed
to be made under normal operating conditions.</li>
                    <li>The
vane movement should be set up, so that the vane is set to start
allowing power take up within a few percent of the movement from the
"zero" position.</li>
                    <li>A good displacement
transducer should be mounted and calibrated accurately to reflect vane
position. The transducer should be hysteresis free, and obviously must
be capable of withstanding operating conditions.&nbsp; (Experience has
shown that potentiometers are not ideal in this application.) </li>
                    <li>High and low limit switches should be mounted to interlock vane drive movement when the limits are reached.</li>
                    <li> A planned maintenance schedule should be set-up to check the units and the calibration at regular intervals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><i>2. Main Conveyor Drive Motors</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ideally
all motors on the same conveyor should be of the same power rating and
matched if possible.&nbsp; However this may be difficult to implement
at this stage due to cost.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><i>3. Control Strategy (Refer to Figure 2)</i></p>
                <p><img id="Picture3" src="case_history_89_files/cashis89fig2.jpg" alt="cashis89fig2" title="cashis89fig2" align="top" border="0" height="428" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="750"></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The
existing controller block and structure should be scrapped.&nbsp; It
would be far better to use the standard continuous controller block in
the PLC, which is extremely versatile, and which is far easier to
understand, set-up, and tune.</li>
                    <li>Two
of these control blocks would be used, the one to control the vane
position, and the other to control the power. The reason for this is
that both of these processes have entirely different dynamics, and each
controller would be tuned to deal with the specific individual dynamic.
The output of the power controller, referred to as the master
controller, would set the setpoint of the vane "slave" controller. A
good way to think of this is that the slave controller is specifically
tuned to deal with the dynamics and inherent problems of the fluid
coupling, and thus will ensure that the coupling provides the power
into the system as demanded by the master controller.</li>
                    <li>The
master power controller can now be tuned relatively slowly to ensure
robustness (safety of tuning), for varying conditions that will occur
such as varying belt load at start-up.&nbsp; A slow tune is a robust
(safe) tune, which is fine, as it not necessary to start-up a belt
quickly, and it has the twin-fold advantages of ensuring that the two
control systems don't interact, and also that tuning should not need
changing very often, even with dynamics in the coupling changing with
time, temperature, and differing oil viscosity.</li>
                    <li>The
purpose of the bias power adjust is to allow very easy adjustment of
load sharing between the various drive motors on a conveyor,
particularly when running after start-up.&nbsp; Such adjustment can be
done manually from the SCADA or else if the system is really
successful, and the load sharing varies a lot, then a not too difficult
programme could be written in the PLC to perform it automatically.</li>
                    <li>The
power lineariser block is to linearise the relationship between vane
position and motor power. This allows a single tuning in the power
controller to be optimal across the entire range of vane position.</li>
                    <li>Virtually
the entire control strategy shown in Figure 2 can be implemented in the
two controller blocks. The pulse output is a standard option in the
controller. The bias&nbsp; power adjust can be performed through the
"disturbance variable" input in the power controller, and there is
provision in the system to incorporate a lineariser block in the vane
position controller.</li>
                    <ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>This
proposed new system will definitely be far more effective and stable
than the existing one, provided it is implemented correctly.</p>
