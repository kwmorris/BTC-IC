      enemy?</FONT></B><FONT face=Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica size=-1>
      <P>This Loop Signature series of articles would not be complete without 
      sections on the problems of noise and filtering which are two of the most 
      misunderstood areas in process control.
      <P>For the purpose of this discussion, noise can be defined as a random 
      variation in the PV (process variable) signal around a mean level.&nbsp; 
      There can be various causes for this, but generally it is caused by the 
      process itself or by the measuring method.&nbsp; Typically noise in flows 
      may be caused by turbulence, and in tank levels by ripples and 
      disturbances on the surface of the liquid in the tank.
      <P>Figure 1 shows a portion of a closed loop test on a coarse ore feed 
      conveyor belt.&nbsp;

      <DIV align=center><B>Figure 1</B></DIV>
      <P>It can be seen that the signal coming in from the weightometer is 
      extremely noisy.&nbsp; The amplitude of the noise is approximately 25%, 
      and the noise, when put through a spectrum analyser displays more the 
      characteristics of white noise, and does not show any significant 
      individual harmonic frequencies.&nbsp; The noise in this case is mostly 
      caused by the different sizes of rocks passing over the weightometer.
      <P>What are the detrimental effects of noise?&nbsp; There are really only 
      two.&nbsp; Firstly as far as the control itself is concerned, noise can be 
      transmitted through the controller from input to output and may cause the 
      output to start jumping about.&nbsp; If the final control element (e.g. 
      valve) can follow these movements, it will lead to increased wear on the 
      mechanical components in the final control element, leading to a shorter 
      life, and also the control variance itself may be increased.&nbsp; In the 
      example shown in Figure 1 it can be seen that the noise on the output of 
      the controller is so small that it will not cause the ore feed system to 
      respond to it. 
      <P>Secondly the noise can create problems amongst the human beings who are 
      using the control system, like operators, process people, and control and 
      instrument personnel.
      <P>Generally the more serious of the two problems is the latter - the 
      effect of noise on humans!&nbsp; 
      <P>To understand what I am getting at, refer to Figure 2, which shows two 
      people in the plant looking at a pressure reading.&nbsp; The operator is 
      looking at a digital signal on his screen, and sees the pressure as 3.532 
      bars.&nbsp; The other man is out in the plant looking at the pressure on 
      the dial of a pressure gauge.&nbsp; He sees the position of the needle on 
      the scale relative to the range, and also that the pressure is about 3.5 
      bars.

      <DIV align=center><B>Figure 2</B></DIV>
      <P>The operator reading the digital signal, is completely reliant on the 
      actual value displayed.&nbsp; He has no reference to a relative value, and 
      has no immediate idea if the value is high or low, whereas the person 
      looking at the gauge can immediately see roughly what and "where" the 
      value is.
      <P>For control purposes on most loops, one is not too worried about 
      absolute accurate values. It is generally more important that the process 
      be kept at the setpoint value.&nbsp; In the old days of analogue 
      instruments, operators often used to make a mark with a pen on the PV 
      scale on the controller at the value at where they wanted the PV to be 
      controlled.&nbsp; You normally are not interested in controlling to 3 
      decimal places, and even with the best control in the world, your PV on 
      most industrial processes is always jumping around a certain amount due to 
      noise and minor load variations going on in the process.
      <P>With noisy signals one has a much better idea of where your measurement 
      is, by reading the information on an analogue indicator, or even better on 
      a trend display or recording.&nbsp; If you try to view it on a digital 
      indicator all you see are numbers jumping around and you have little idea 
      of what is actually happening.
      <P>In pre-digital days, it was difficult, and also expensive to filter 
      signals, particularly with longer time constants, and people accepted 
      noisy displays quite happily.&nbsp; However in modern times, digital 
      technology allows one to write filters into the software very 
      easily.&nbsp;&nbsp; It only takes a few lines of code.&nbsp; Furthermore 
      the time constant of the filters can be set to any number you please, even 
      hours.&nbsp; One of the first thing people now often do when programming 
      digital control systems, is to suppress the noise by putting large filters 
      onto the PV signal.
      <P>To illustrate these points with a real example, refer to Figure 
      3.&nbsp;

      <P>This is a portion of a SCADA display showing the feed control to a 
      milling system on a mine.&nbsp; There is a weightometer on the belt 
      calibrated 0- 200 tonnes.&nbsp; The accuracy of this instrument would be 
      at best ±1% FS, which equates to ±2 tonnes.&nbsp; However the person who 
      drew the SCADA screen shows 5 numerals after the decimal point, which is 
      ridiculous.&nbsp; However the Operator will believe the figure absolutely.
      <P>As can be imagined on a really noisy measurement like ore mass, the 
      reading is jumping up and down quite considerably.&nbsp; A typical SCADA 
      display updates every 2 or 3 seconds.&nbsp; In a case like this the last 7 
      digits of the display will probably&nbsp; be jumping around on virtually 
      every update.&nbsp; To overcome this, the I&amp;C personnel at the mine 
      had put huge filters on the PV so as to allow a steady reading.
      <P>As very often the case on feed conveyors, the loop was extremely badly 
      tuned.&nbsp; Figure 4 shows the closed loop "as-found" test with the 
      existing tuning parameters.&nbsp;

      <P>When a 10% setpoint change was made in the positive direction, it can 
      be clearly seen that the response was almost unstable.&nbsp; When the 
      setpoint was stepped back to the original value, it can be seen how long 
      it took to get the process right back to setpoint.&nbsp; Please note that 
      this recording was made with the Protuner analyser connected upstream of 
      the filters, so the true mass signal is seen.&nbsp; (In the next loop 
      signature article I will show you what the Operator will see on changes 
      with big filters).
      <P>All the filters were removed and the loop retuned.&nbsp; Figure 5 shows 
      the final test, with setpoint changes of 10% up, 10% down, and then 20% 
      down being made.&nbsp; It can be seen just how good the control now is.

      <P>The important thing here is that the quality of the control can be 
      clearly judged using the trends, but it would be impossible to do the same 
      using the digital display.
      <P>I worked with the Operator when this work was performed, and explained 
      to him that he must judge control on trends, and not on digital 
      displays.&nbsp; He understood the reasoning, and was quite happy, 
      particularly as it was the very first time they were able to run the 
      milling system in automatic.&nbsp; Unfortunately he didn't pass this 
      information onto the night operator, who when he switched to the milling 
      screen immediately saw the mass jumping all over the place.&nbsp; What 
      does this mean to an uninformed person who is used to filtered 
      signals?&nbsp; He thinks the control has gone unstable.&nbsp;&nbsp; What 
      does he do then?&nbsp; He puts it into manual, as he knows this is the 
      best way to stop a loop cycling.&nbsp; In this case, to his horror the 
      signal still kept jumping around.&nbsp; He then tripped the plant and 
      called out all the relevant people.
      <P>This is in fact one of my biggest problems.&nbsp; I spend a lot of time 
      in plants removing filters and improving the controls.&nbsp; However 
      although I explain the reasoning to the people I work with at the time, 
      they generally do not pass this information on, and there are always 
      complaints later on that the control was much better before, and it is now 
      worse and quite unstable, as the process people do not understand the 
      difference between instability and noise.
      <P>As will be shown in the next loop signature article, filters can in 
      fact completely distort the information being viewed by the Operator, and 
      in reality are generally undesirable.&nbsp; It therefore becomes extremely 
      important that Operation personnel receive proper training about the 
      effects of noise and filtering.
