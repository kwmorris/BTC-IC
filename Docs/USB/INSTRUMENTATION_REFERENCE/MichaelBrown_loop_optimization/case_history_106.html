                CAN SUCCEED IN THESE TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES</font></u></b></h4>
<b><u>                </u></b>
                <p><font face="Arial">We are living through one of the worst
                worldwide economic crises of all times. There is huge
                uncertainty everywhere as to how long it will last, with world
                leading investment and financial gurus talking years. Even more
                scary is the fact that many people who are experts in the
                financial world are scared that we haven&#8217;t even seen the real
                &#8220;crunch&#8221; yet, and an even worse melt-down lies yet ahead.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">To an engineer like myself, to whom
                economics and the ways of the financial world are really a grey
                area, it is incomprehensible that this has happened, and that we
                have found ourselves in this situation. When I did a management
                course in the late 1960&#8217;s, I was told that the economists had
                now so much scientific understanding, that it would be
                impossible for the world to ever again have a major recession,
                let alone a depression. However since that time we have suffered
                3 fairly bad stock-market crashes. We have been repeatedly told
                that the only way to really make your savings increase is to
                invest in equities, and whatever you do, not to leave your money
                earning interest in the bank. After finding I did not have the
                time or knowledge, and was not too good in investing in the
                stock-market myself, I decided to invest through funds headed by
                experts who have a wealth of experience, huge research teams,
                and should be able to increase your funds dramatically. However
                my general experience on the whole is that in spite of being
                charged substantial fees (whether your funds did well or not), I
                probably would have been much better off leaving my money in
                something like a Money Market Fund, and cheerfully paying a
                large chunk of my earnings to our friendly SARS.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">I also find it incomprehensible that the
                whole world is dependent on the economic health of the USA,
                which country is, and has been technically bankrupt for years,
                owing countries like Japan and China trillions of dollars. To an
                engineer it doesn&#8217;t make any sense. It certainly is like
                building skyscrapers on a quicksand without any foundations.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">The sad thing about it is how it is
                affecting the lives of virtually all the people on Mother Earth.
                There is a huge shortage of skilled and experienced technical
                people in many countries in the world, and particularly in
                Southern Africa. The brain drain in our own South Africa has
                been alarming over the last few years.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">People with process and control and
                instrumentation skills have always been in high demand. I have
                been told many times by these people, that one thing they are
                sure about is that they will never be out of a job.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">However what has happened? Turnover of
                companies has dropped dramatically. They have to cut back, and
                make savings. How do they do this? Firstly they lay off people.
                In many cases they look at laying off the older people who can
                be got rid of more easily. Then they lay off the &#8220;last-in&#8221;
                people who were the most recent to join. Skills don&#8217;t seem to
                come into the equation.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">I have quite a sad example of this. I had
                an excellent and highly experienced C&amp;I consulting engineer
                who worked for a large mining group on a course in November last
                year. He is a man in his late 40&#8217;s. He wanted to leave South
                Africa, and his company said they could use him in Australia. He
                left with his family in December, full of plans on optimising
                the controls of the mines he would be responsible for in
                Australia. Things went well for him in January and February, and
                we corresponded quite a few times. In March he emailed me to
                tell me that the company has decided to suspend their Australian
                operations, and he has been made redundant. Terrible! Since then
                I have heard of quite a few very intelligent people with a lot
                of experience who have been retrenched.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Great! The companies concerned have saved
                themselves a lot of money. However they don&#8217;t seem to realise
                that one day, hopefully not too far in the future, things will,
                as they must do, swing the other way. When they want to start
                increasing production again they will find they have lost a huge
                base of skills and experience, which will severely hamper their
                growth.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Back to the present. The companies are
                laying off people, cutting back production, but they still haven&#8217;t
                managed to save enough money. So they look round for other ways
                of cutting budgets. To many companies the next most obvious
                thing is to cut all training. I find it unbelievable how many
                companies have done this. Once again this can only have a very
                adverse affect on these companies in the long run, particularly
                in the field of control, where there is already a huge dearth of
                knowledge. The other thing I have also seen is that there seems
                to be very little effort to try and improve plant efficiency.
                This normally involves calling in outside experts, which costs
                money. So they don&#8217;t go this route. It seems to be very short
                sighted.</font></p>
                <font size="2">
                </font><p><font size="2"></font><font face="Arial">However I was really encouraged a
                couple of days ago. The chief process manager of a large group
                of process plants asked me to meet him. He started off by
                telling me that he has been instructed by top management to cut
                back on all expenses by 10%. He then told them, that not only is
                he going to do that, but at the same time he is going to try and
                increase productivity by 10%.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">How could he achieve this miracle? Very
                interesting. Basically he had realised that their plants were
                not running at all efficiently. Some of them, particularly some
                that were many years old, were using inefficient production and
                process methods, and were following bad practices that had been
                accepted as normal over the years. Several process refinements
                and improvements have already been made on some plants, and it
                could be seen how much more efficient certain processes had
                become with potentially huge savings, particularly in reagents.
                However it had also become apparent that these innovations
                depended largely on skilful operators, because the control
                systems were not performing well.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Unfortunately for a variety of reasons in
                their particular industry, the operators are relatively
                unskilled, and most are not highly educated. Therefore it has
                become imperative that to lower the reliance on operators, the
                working of the automatic control systems must be improved.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Virtually all their plants have fairly
                modern computerised control equipment installed. However the
                process experts and the existing C&amp;I personnel have realised
                it is not working as it should, and that they would need outside
                assistance to find out how to improve things. Hence our meeting.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">The company has already taken the decision
                that both process and C&amp;I personnel need to work together on
                effecting improvements in the control side. This falls in
                exactly with what I have been preaching for many years. Firstly
                optimisation is a team effort and needs a high degree of
                cooperation between these departments to succeed. In every case
                that I have ever come across, optimisation efforts purely on the
                part of the C&amp;I people does not work. Secondly there <i>has</i>
                to be full and enthusiastic support by both top and middle
                management. Without these two elements, any optimisation effort
                is doomed to failure.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">The thinking at this stage is to initially
                start off with a really small, but full time optimisation team
                consisting of a senior process engineer, and a very bright
                C&amp;I technician. They will initially undergo a 5 day
                classroom course on practical optimisation of regulatory control
                loops. After that they will undertake an audit in conjunction
                with the instructor on certain of the more important and
                critical control loops in some of their plants. Once that has
                been done, management will then decide on how to proceed
                further. If it goes as expected , a few more people will be
                trained and seconded to the team. There will also be some
                training given to quite a few other people of various
                disciplines in the various plants, so they can understand what
                is being done, and lend their support to the optimisation
                efforts. It is really also vitally important that plant
                personnel come on &#8220;board&#8221;. If they don&#8217;t understand what
                is happening, and start resisting changes, which is very human,
                then the whole optimisation exercise could be in jeopardy.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">The whole thing to me shows the
                intelligent approach that process companies should be taking to
                improve things in these difficult times. All effort should be
                made to improve efficiency of production. It could be a &#8220;life-saver&#8221;.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">To finish off I would like to reprint the
                following quiz which was originally published in Case History
                17. This will give you some idea of how well your controls are
                working, and if there is a need to improve things:</font></p>

<b><u>                </u></b>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Our experience shows that
                over 65% of feedback control loops in automatic are operating
                ineffectively, and less than 15% have anything close to optimum
                tuning parameters. It costs approximately R50,000 to automate a
                control loop. In spite of this, the poor state of the controls
                in a plant are generally accepted as normal. In fact very few
                people are even aware that the loops are not working properly.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">To help you to judge approximately how
                well the loops in your plant are operating, we have devised the

                hundreds of plants over a wide range of industries in various
                countries. Take a few minutes to study the questions. If
                necessary research them, and answer them as honestly as
                possible.</font></p>

                b) Carry out a full loop analysis involving a series of open and

                control loops in your plant, of which you may not even be aware.
                If this is the case, ask yourself why all that money was
                originally spent on automating the plant, if it is not working
                properly. Also enumerate the obtainable benefits if control was
                improved. These would include increased productivity, better
                quality, and decreased running costs. Would it not be worthwhile
                considering investing some time and money to improve the
                control? It will require commitment on the part of senior and
                middle management. You will also have to invest in some
