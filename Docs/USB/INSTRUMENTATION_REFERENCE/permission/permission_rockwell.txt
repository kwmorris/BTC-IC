                                    
I did some more surfing on the Rockwell site this
morning, and found the "Manuals Online" link.  
Cool stuff.  Just for formality's sake, could you 
send an email to me confirming it's okay to copy 
these manuals onto CD-ROM for student use?  These 
disks will be used for educational purposes at 
BTC only, and they will not be sold.  Thank you!

Tony,

Go ahead and put the manuals from Rockwell on CD
for your students, we appreciate the free advertising!

Thanks, and have a good weekend.
