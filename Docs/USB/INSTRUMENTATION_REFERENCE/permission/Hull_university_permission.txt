Many thanks for your kind comments about our leaflets.   I have 
passed your email on to our Maths. tutor, Lynn Towse, for her to 
see. We do not mind you using our leaflets for your students. All we
would ask is that our institution is duly acknowledged.

Nice to hear from you

Katy

Dear Tony

Katy Barnett copied her reply to you regarding the worksheets on the Hull
University website.  

After teaching for some years I retired but was then asked to join the
University "to help students who had problems with Maths"! I did this
 for 6
years until July 2002 when I decided to retire (again).  I found myself writing
material for students as a response to them having problems in particular ares.
 As time went on I wrote more and more and we decided to put them onto the
Maths Advice & Coordination Service website. Later the Service expanded to
include to include English, IT and Study Skills and became the Study Advice
Service.  The leaflets were then moved to the SAS website.  

Anyway, so much for the history, I'm pleased to hear that someone else has
 found
the leaflets useful.  I do hope they do what you want them to and that you
don't find any errors!!

Don
