Hi Thomas,

I have not seen this kind of request before, and 
I'm not sure you would be the one to answer, but 
this is a technical school in Washington State 
that is asking to download some material from our 
website for use in training materials.  I have 
yet to respond, so let me know if you have any 
concerns about this.

Regards,

To Whom it may Concern,

I am an instructor of instrumentation at Bellingham 
Technical College in Washington state, and am in 
the process of compiling a reference CD-ROM for 
my students' use.  Having an "offline" reference 
is important for students who do not have fast 
internet service, or internet service at all at 
their homes.  I am interested in copying some of 
your technical reference PDF files from your 
website on to these disks.  Specifically, you 
provide a few "fundamentals" tutorial documents 
at this URL that interest me:

    http://www.krohne-mar.com/Brochures___Catalogues__DLC.11317.0.html

Please let me know if this use of your material 
would be permissible.  These CD-ROM disks will 
only be used for students' educational purposes, 
and they will not be sold.  Of course I will give 
proper attribution to you as the author and 
provider of this material on the CD-ROM.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
