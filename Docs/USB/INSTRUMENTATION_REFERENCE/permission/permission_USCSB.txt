Comment: I would like to confirm that the USCSB 
investigative reports (PDF documents) are in the 
public domain, and may be freely copied and 
distributed.  These documents are highly useful 
as teaching tools for my Instrumentation and 
Control Technology students, as we use them for 
case studies and control system analysis 
activities.  I would like to host copies of these 
files on a private website, as well as link them 
in our college library catalog, for easy download.  
It is my understanding that being federal 
documents, they are in the public domain (not 
copyrighted), but I would like to confirm this to
be on the safe side of legal.
