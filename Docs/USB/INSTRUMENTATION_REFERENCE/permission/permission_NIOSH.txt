Tony,

The Pocket Guide is in the public domain and can 
be freely copied or reprinted.  The only 
restriction on this would be if you were to sell 
them.  But since you are not doing that, you are 
free to use the Pocket Guide in the way that you 
describe.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

To Whom it may Concern,

I am an instructor of instrumentation at Bellingham
Technical College in Washington state, and am in 
the process of compiling a reference CD-ROM for my 
students' use.  Having an "offline" reference is 
important for students who do not have fast internet
service, or internet service at all at their homes.
I am interested in copying your "NIOSH pocket guide 
to chemical hazards" PDF document to this CD-ROM:

    http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/pdfs/2005-149.pdf

Please let me know if this use of your material 
would be permissible.  These CD-ROM disks will only 
be used for students' educational purposes, and 
they will not be sold.  Of course I will give 
proper attribution to you as the author and 
provider of this material on the CD-ROM.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Sincerely,

Tony Kuphaldt
