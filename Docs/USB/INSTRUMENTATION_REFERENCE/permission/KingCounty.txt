Hi Mr. Kuphaldt,

Please consider this permission to use the technical report as a case 
study, copying and distributing the document as needed.  Thank you 
for being sensitive to permissions for use of information; your 
attention to this is appreciated.

I would be interested in knowing about your class and how this works 
for you as a case study.  We are working to respond to questions and 
also use this unfortunate and unprecedented incident as a "teachable 
moment" about infrastructure, so it would be interesting to know how 
it works for your purposes.  I have covered one of these "teachable 
moments" in our blog. 

Thank you again for checking in with us on the use of this report.

Regards,

Monica
