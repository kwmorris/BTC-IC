Hi Tony,

That sounds fine. Thanks for letting me know, but it's not a problem at all.

BTW, I have two new books:

 Simple Nature:
      http://www.lightandmatter.com/area1sn.html

 Discover Physics:
      http://www.lightandmatter.com/area1dp.html

Are these students engineering majors? If so, then Simple Nature might be more like
the level they need. Simple Nature is also a real open-source project, with the source
code available in LaTeX format.
